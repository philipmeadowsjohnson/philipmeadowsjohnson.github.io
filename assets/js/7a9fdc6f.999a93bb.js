The temple is several stories high. The ground floor is filled with sculpture and iconography representing the spirit and animal world, the second floor represents the human world, the third floor represents heaven, and when you climb up the final staircase, you arrive on the roof with a shrine to Buddha which represents Nirvana and has spectacular views of the surrounding valley and mountains."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"When we descended to leave the temple, we found a small selection of religious items for sale including prayer beads (108 small sandlewood beads which you use as an aid to meditation).

In the space of a couple of minutes, we went from no matches to full-on Buddhist ceremony with a chanting Lama, burning incense and oil lamps, offerings of tsa-tsas, and hoisting of prayer flags on the hillside above the lake.
