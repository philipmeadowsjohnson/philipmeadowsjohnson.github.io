I remember going outside to see if anyone was in the back yard, and when I didn't see anyone out there, I decided to go over to the next door neighbor's house and knock on their kitchen door. I don't remember what I was going to say, or do, but I do remember that right when the neighbor arrived at the door, Grandmother ran up and got me.
