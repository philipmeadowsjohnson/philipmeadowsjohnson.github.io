If we played at my house, we would usually go down the basement, and maybe play ping-pong. If we played at his house, we might also play in his basement, or else watch TV in their den, or play in his backyard. Chicky's backyard was a little better for playing in than our backyard, since it was fenced in so that balls would not escape into the street."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Well, on this particular day, Chicky Taylor and I tried playing in his basement, but there was nothing fun to do down there. So then we went upstairs to his bedroom, but nothing seemed fun to do up there either.

Now, to understand why we got into trouble, you need to understand that our houses were facing each other on opposite sides of Ridge Road. They were actually quite close to each other, maybe only 50 feet apart, but Ridge Road had a certain amount of traffic on it. Thus, when Chicky Taylor and I were small, we weren't allowed to cross the street by ourselves to go to each other's houses. Instead, we had to ask our Moms to come out of the house and walk us across the road."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Now, you know Moms.

So we went into Chicky Taylor's garage and found two shovels, and went back to the backyard and decided that the perfect spot to begin digging the tunnel was in the corner of the yard, just next to the fence that overlooked Ridge Road."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Of course, there was a nice row of flowers and bushes there, but we didn't worry ourselves about them in the slightest. We started digging and throwing dirt around, and after maybe ten or fifteen minutes, we had dug a hole about waist high (for five year olds).

And, we were thirsty."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"So, we climbed out of the hole and trotted into the house to look in the refrigerator for something to drink.
