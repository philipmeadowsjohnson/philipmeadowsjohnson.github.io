First off, he was very nice and fun to be with. Second, he was captain of the swim team. Third, his bedroom was, as Wayne and Garth might put it, a "Babe Lair". It was down in the basement of the Montgomery house, away from everything else, and dimly lit even in the daytime. The walls were covered with psychedelic posters and he had black lights for illumination. Most of the room was occupied by a huge, octagonal waterbed. Finally, he had a totally awesome quadrophonic stereo system with a nice selection of quadrophonic records---the only person I ever knew with a quad stereo. We would go down there and listen to songs like Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple and Roundabout by Yes. Not only did the music envelop you, it would actually spin around the room at times. It was incredible.'),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"During this summer, the Montgomerys invited me to accompany them on a weekend trip up north to Boyne Mountain, which in the summer offered hiking, tennis, golf, canoeing, and swimming.

Monty and I were sitting directly across the table from Tom, so we had a front row seat for what happened next. Unfortunately for Tom, the previous user of the ketchup bottle had neglected to actually screw the bottle cap tight, but instead simply placed the cap onto the top of the bottle. So, upon Tom's first vigorous shake of the bottle, the top went flying off backwards over his right shoulder.
