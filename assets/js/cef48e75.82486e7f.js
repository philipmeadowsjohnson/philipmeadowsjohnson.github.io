It stopped being fun and started being a drag, both physically and emotionally.

Steve Bazos, for example, had a friend with a show on Hawaii Public Radio on Saturday nights at midnight.  After playing the show twice, I said it was just too late for me.  Shakadown Street showed me that, even at its most amateur level, I am not cut out for the rock and roll lifestyle."))}f.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
