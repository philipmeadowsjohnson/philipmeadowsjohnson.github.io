Also at some point during these years, Chicky Taylor stories escaped from the bedroom. I remember telling Chicky Taylor stories when we drove across the country from Detroit to California in our Ford Windstar, during hikes through Australian rain forests, and on the way to and from Ice Palace birthday parties.  As a side-effect, some of Jenna's and Katie's friends also came to know and request Chicky Taylor stories from time to time. To my delight, Jenna once fulfilled a high school writing assignment by writing a story about the Chicky Taylor stories."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"The narrative elements of Chicky Taylor stories, being intended to appeal to young girls, generally focused on the tendency toward misbehavior and general cluelessness of young boys. Another important element of a Chicky Taylor story is digression: since the actual anecdote could typically be related in about 10 seconds, I needed to fill things out to appropriate bedtime story length with any quasi-related childhood details that popped into my head at that moment."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Katie is now in high school, and Jenna has graduated from college, and I am now very rarely asked to tell a Chicky Taylor story.
