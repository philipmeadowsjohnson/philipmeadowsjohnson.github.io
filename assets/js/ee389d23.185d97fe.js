Twice we passed elephants being ridden along the road. Joanne convinced me to take a 5 km detour almost straight up the side of a mountain pass to the tribal village of Mon Chong. Apparently the farmers used to focus on opium poppies, but the Thai government chose Mon Chong to experiment on ecotourism as a replacement for the drug trade, so now they grow vegetables that are bought by the government and also served in a restaurant at the summit of a mountain pass with drop-dead views. The experiment appears to be working: it was the high point of our day.

We learned that Buddhist meditation comes in two basic flavors: mindfulness and insight. While the retreat focused only on mindfulness meditation, we tried out a great many postures:  four types of sitting mediation, two types of standing meditation, two types of lying meditation, and six types of walking meditation. We also practiced indoors and outdoors, and had both \u201cguided\u201d meditation sessions (in which the monk would lead us), along with \u201cfreestyle\u201d sessions (where we could pick our approach and do it indoors or out).
