On this particular afternoon, we were downstairs in Chicky Taylor's basement. To understand this story, you need to know how Chicky Taylor's basement was laid out. There were four rooms in Chicky Taylor's basement, and two staircases from the basement up to the rest of the house. If you came down the staircase from the front of the house, which was carpeted, you arrived in a kind of basement foyer, with three rooms branching off from it. One room had a couch, a fireplace, and a pool table. The second room had a ping-pong table and a floor-to-ceiling built-in shelving unit where there were lots of games like Operation, Clue, Trouble, and so forth. The third room contained stuff for Mr. and Mrs. Taylor, including tools, the washer and dryer, and a freezer.
