If you don\u2019t yet believe we are frogs in boiling water, consider little old Bhutan, which has instituted universal, free health care (including all drugs) for everyone within the borders of their country including visitors. Furthermore, if a person in Bhutan has a problem that their medical system can\u2019t handle, the government will fly you to a country with more advanced medical services and pay all associated costs. The Bhutan government finances free health care for all on a national per capita income of $3,000 per year. The US per capita income is approximately 20 times Bhutan\u2019s. Let\u2019s face it: The reason we don\u2019t have universal, free health care is not because America can\u2019t afford it.

Perhaps it\u2019s because our capitalist/democratic system is based on the premise that it\u2019s good to accumulate wealth, and a few wealthy, powerful people will become even more wealthy and more powerful from Arctic drilling. The interesting thing about this explanation is that it implies that as long as someone accumulates wealth, the short or long term economics don\u2019t matter. Nor do externalities.

For his part, Kyle agreed that it\'s gonna be a rough patch, but that a few humans will survive.  Ah, the optimistic blush of youth, I thought.  Just you wait until you\'re as old as I am, and you\'ll be just as pessimistic and cynical as your old man.

You refer frequently to the US economic system with its wealth accumulation goal, our failing government and how things might end up in the future. However, I think you miss an important point with respect to the incredible importance of the US. The US inherited its economic system from the western Europeans who colonized the Americas. Indeed, both you and I are descendants of western Europeans as were our parents, so it is only logical that our parents can be quoted making comments such as your father's in support of our inherited capitalist economy.  Ultimately, like all children we were brainwashed into our parents' system. The natural wealth of our land and our fortunate race, socio-economic class and time in history allowed us, and others more aggressive than us, to very effectively take this inherited concept of wealth accumulation, private property and exploitation of natural resources and create a GIGANTIC SPECTACLE that shines like a bright star within our atmosphere. This intense light on the horizon penetrates into every locale around the world - in many cases outshining anything else available in such places. This bright light is universally attractive to people who have less and struggle for life's necessities; it exerts an incredible attractive force. Everyone wants the icons of this western life style and the wealth to achieve them. Only insular cultures like Bhutan with no colonial past and careful centralized control of societal inputs are able to resist such an attractive force. In this way the American (Western European) culture, economy and means to achieve it have spread around the world. This has created a world full of exploiters using up whatever natural resources they can get their hands on, competing for wealth, and nrelentlessly yearning for the icons of western life."))),(0,n.kt)("p",null,'The climate change challenge then becomes finding a way to transform this bright light on the horizon into an infinitely sustainable "green glow on the horizon". If the US can achieve this, it will be of incredible international significance. The effect will be felt worldwide as long as our cultural icons (Hollywood, CocaCola, the fashion industry, automakers, advertisers, etc) buy into it and "sell" it to the world. To me this is the ultimate message and way forward for our children, grand-children and great-grandchildren. Our generation needs to start this transformation, in order for the world to still be a habitable place for them to live.  If we fail, I really don\'t think the type of government or leaders we have will make a difference, we need a full on transformation of our societal goals.'),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Clearly, the challenges are great and are much more than personally composting, buying PV's and EV's or even electing progressive leaders.
