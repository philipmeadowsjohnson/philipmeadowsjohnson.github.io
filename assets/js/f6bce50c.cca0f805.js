That said, Bhutan in the winter is great!  The skies are an incredible shade of blue, the days can be mild, the mountains are snow-capped and gorgeous, and other tourists are, for the most part, absent. For example, we are currently the only occupants of a beautiful hotel in central Bhutan, and it is rare to run into more than a couple other tourists at any of the numerous places we visit in a day. Our guide confirms that during the high season (Spring and Fall), things get very crowded and busy. So we feel very lucky to be here right now."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"We told you about the surprise snowfall in our last email. The next day, our itinerary took us over Dochula Pass (10,000 feet) to get to Punakha Valley. Dochula Pass is the site of a commemoration of a military victory by Bhutan over some Indian rebel forces and takes the form of 108 chortens (small stupas). See the attached photo of three chortens with the Himalayas in the background. By the way, those peaks in the background are around 24,000 feet, and beyond them is Tibet! Also, that snow on the chortens is not typical: recall that this was the biggest snowfall in this area in five years. As a result, what should have been a one hour descent into Punakha Valley took almost 4 hours, with traffic completely stopped for 10-30 minute intervals, and they closed the pass to traffic entirely just as we arrived at the bottom."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,'We had an incredible couple of days in Punakha Valley, but to keep this email manageable we will skip ahead to the day where we traveled to a small farming village called Tangsibje where we did a "home stay" at a cousin of one of the owners of the tour company. This cousin is a farmer (9 cows, vegetable garden and rice paddies), and the husband is also notable for winning the "Strongest Man in Bhutan" contest in 2014.  Our guide told us that winning the competition was a very mixed blessing, as he is now frequently off helping people build houses or do other things requiring significant muscle power. Indeed, we didn\'t get to meet him during our night in Tangsibje. However, we did get a little taste for what it\'s like to live in rural Bhutan.  Attached is a photo of us with our driver Hasta (on the left) and the sister of the Strong Man and her son (on the right) eating dinner in their kitchen.
