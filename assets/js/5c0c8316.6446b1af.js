First, you made the outline of the rink with long pieces of wood. Then, you shoveled the snow off the grass inside the rink. Then, you got out a hose and watered down the area in the evening when it was as cold as possible so that the water would freeze quickly. If you left the hose outside, you had to make sure that you got all of the water out of the hose so that it wouldn't freeze inside the hose. Of course, Chicky Taylor's garage was heated, so we would just drag the hose inside the garage between waterings. If you were lucky and the weather stayed cold, in two or three days you would have enough of a rink to start skating on."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"In the summer, though, our favorite sport to play was baseball. Back in those days, we were still small enough that it was fun to play baseball in Chicky's back yard. One of us would pitch the ball to the other, and if the other hit it, then you'd run around the bases and try to not be tagged out. First base was the corner of the garage, second base was a big maple tree near the fence, third base was a bush, and home plate was a few leaves that we'd pile together at the end of the yard opposite the maple tree."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Chicky Taylor and I would usually imagine ourselves to be players for the Detroit Tigers. Depending upon who was doing well recently, we might pick Denny McClain (a pitcher), Bill Freehan (catcher), or Norm Cash (first baseman). But our favorite Tigers to pretend to be were both outfielders: Chicky favored Al Kaline, while I liked Willie Horton."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"If the ball ever escaped from the backyard, it was usually from a foul ball that went backwards over the fence behind us, which was just chest high. In that case, we could climb over the fence and run into the neighbor's yard to get it back.

The lady was sitting in a chair right next to a window that looked out over Ridge Road and Chicky Taylor's back yard."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Chicky and I knew nothing of my parents' entertainment situation.

Normally, whenever one of us hit the ball like this, it would strike a branch, pinball around making thudding noises, and finally fall out of the tree and to the ground. With luck, the pitcher could actually run over and catch the ball as it fell out of tree and get the batter out."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,'This time, the ball somehow sailed right through the tree without so much as touching a leaf.

I suppose they were serving tea and cookies, and talking about such adult matters as the upcoming garden show, or an article in the Sunday paper, or who had just moved into or out of the neighborhood.
