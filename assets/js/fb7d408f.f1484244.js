In general we are seeing incredible investment in public access to beautiful natural areas: trails, gardens, walkways, clean public restrooms, and general accessibility.

Well, we had to fact check this one, and actually Lake Taupo is dwarfed by Lake Superior. And get this: along the Lake Taupo walkway are steaming thermal vents making the lake warm and even boiling at some spots along the edges. The walkway has occasional \u201cdanger boiling water\u201d signs!
