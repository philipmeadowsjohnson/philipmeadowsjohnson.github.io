On this particular afternoon, we were downstairs in Chicky Taylor's basement. To understand this story, you need to know how Chicky Taylor's basement was laid out. There were four rooms in Chicky Taylor's basement, and two staircases from the basement up to the rest of the house. If you came down the staircase from the front of the house, which was carpeted, you arrived in a kind of basement foyer, with three rooms branching off from it. One room had a couch, a fireplace, and a pool table. The second room had a ping-pong table and a floor-to-ceiling built-in shelving unit where there were lots of games like Operation, Clue, Trouble, and so forth. The third room contained stuff for Mr. and Mrs. Taylor, including tools, the washer and dryer, and a freezer. The third room also had a staircase, which was not carpeted, that went up to the kitchen."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"We were allowed to play as much as we wanted in any of the rooms except the third room, although we could walk through it to use the back staircase to the kitchen.

This was one of those freezers that were waist high, and opened from the top. Chicky and I opened it up and took a look inside. There were packages of frozen meat, and frozen vegetables, and this being the 1960's, probably some frozen TV dinners."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"There were also several tubes of frozen cookie dough."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Chicky and I took a tube of frozen cookie dough out of the freezer."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Our stomachs started to growl, as we looked a the picture of cookies on the wrapping."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Then, we peeled off some of the wrapping, and took a tentative nibble at the frozen cookie dough.
