I learned that the results of a dozen people working together collaboratively can be amazing. I also learned that it can be difficult to align the artistic goals of a dozen people over an extended period of time.  People tend to talk about "ego" as the reason for band drama, but that was not my experience.  What I found was that producing high quality art requires an intense focus and commitment, and that maintaining that level of energy over time is only possible when you get enough out of the experience to continue.  If your personal and artistic goals aren\'t aligned, it simply stops being fun and starts being a drag, and eventually you have to bow out.'))}c.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
