Thimphu only gets snow once every couple of years, and this was the biggest snowfall in five years according to our guide.

You can go inside into a temple room where there are 125,000 small (6\" high) Buddha statues. I assume that also holds some sort of record (highest density of Buddha statues?), but didn't check.
