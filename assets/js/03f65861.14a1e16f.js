We tried playing in the basement, but that wasn't any fun. Then, we went into his den, and tried watching TV, but there wasn't anything good on. Then, we went to see what Chicky's sisters were doing, but they told us to go away. Then, we went up to Chicky's bedroom and tried to play cards, but that wasn't any fun either. Let's face it. Chicky Taylor and I were bored. And do you know what happens when little boys get bored?"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"(All together now: They get into TROUBLE!)"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"That's right. On this particular day, we decided to go outside to play. Since it was December, and quite cold and snowy, we had to put on our sweaters, then put on our winter jackets, then put on our gloves, then put on our hats, and then put on our snow boots, and finally we were ready to go outside and tromp around in the snow."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Now, to get to Chicky Taylor's backyard from inside the house, you went out through the kitchen door directly into Chicky Taylor's garage. Chicky Taylor's garage was unusual for our neighborhood in two respects. First, it was not a one car garage. It was not even a two car garage. It was a three car garage. Second, it was a heated garage: in winter it was still warm inside. This last point is quite important, because it meant you could store things in his garage in winter that couldn't be allowed to freeze."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"So, after we got all of our winter clothes on, we headed out into the garage to walk through to the door on the opposite end that let out into Chicky Taylor's backyard. Right as we were opening the door, I noticed something stacked by the door that I'd never seen before. It was several cases of Heineken beer, in cans, that Mr. Taylor had bought in preparation for the party. Back in those days, Heineken beer was both the best and the most expensive beer you could buy."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,'I pointed them out to Chicky, whose eyes lit up and who then exclaimed, "I know something fun we can do with those!"'),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"(At this point I would interrupt the narrative for a little educational session on the wonders of carbonation, such as the following.)"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"So, have you girls ever opened up a bottle of soda and had it fizz? What you need to know is that beer also fizzes when you open it, except a LOT MORE than soda does. And, beer fizzes even more when it's WARM when you open it up. And, beer fizzes EVEN more when it's warm and you SHAKE IT before opening it up."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"So, Chicky opened up one of the cases and grabbed one of the beer cans and handed it to me, then took another one for himself. Then we headed out into the back yard."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Chicky demonstrated the technique. First, you shake the beer can as hard as you can for as long as you can. Then, you point it away from yourself and in whatever direction you want it to go. Finally, you pull just enough on the beer can tab to start it opening. At that point, a tremendous yellowish-white foam spews out of the can and roostertails across the yard. It lasts maybe 3 or 4 seconds, at which point you can shake the can a bit and get a final little spurt of beer to shoot out."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"We thought this was incredibly hilarious, and as soon as we had shot off the first two cans of beer, we ran back inside of the garage to get two more. This time we tried to see if we could write our names in the snow with the foam."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"We kept up with this for quite a while until a lot of the backyard had a thin coating of beer on it, and we had gone through many cans of beer. At that point, one of us got hungry, or thirsty, or maybe we just got cold, but for whatever reason we decided to go back into the house."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"So, we trooped back into the garage and opened the door into the kitchen, where Mrs. Taylor was busy cooking dinner."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"She looked up at us, then looked back down to her pan, then sniffed the air, then looked back at us with a combination of amazement and horror, and said,"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,'"Boys!

Finally, Mrs. Taylor had to march me home across the street and explain to my Mother exactly why I smelled like a brewery. Of course, my Mother had to wash my clothes and make me take a bath."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"And that's the story of Chicky Taylor and the Heinekens."))}c.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
