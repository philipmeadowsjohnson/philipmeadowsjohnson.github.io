For those of us of a certain age, the words ‚ÄúLaos‚Äù and ‚ÄúMekong River‚Äù can stir memories of the nightly news, Walter Cronkite, and horrific images of the Vietnam War. Today, Laos is a rural, poor, mountainous, and exceedingly beautiful country attempting (among other things) to grow its tourist economy. We are happy to be contributing to that effort.

## Down the Mekong River

Just getting to our first stop in Laos was an adventure.  We could have flown there in an hour, but Joanne learned that it was possible to get to Luang Prabang by taking a two day ‚Äúslow boat‚Äù down the Mekong River. This involved a two hour bus ride from Chiang Rai to the border, where we went through immigration and got a tuk-tuk to take us to the river and our boat. Mekong River boats all have the same design:  extremely long and extremely narrow, kind of like aquatic caterpillars. There were at least 50 of us on our boat as we set off for about six hours down the river.  After an overnight in the unremarkable town of Pakbeng, we had another six or eight hours on the river before arriving in Luang Prabang the next day.

(from Joanne:  This was an incredible 2 day experience riding in this Mekong long boat (slow boat, although it went at a good clip, not too fast or too slow) down the river.  Beautiful, and ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I am riding down the Mekong River‚Äù kind of experience.  I was riveted, watching little river communities pass by, stunning bamboo forests, and tropical foliage, mountains on either side, sun playing on the water, and many many fisherman in their skinny long boats.  The Mekong is everything for the area, transportation, food, livelihood.  Our boat would occasionally stop at a village and drop off mail, or someone would get out.  Fantastic.)

## Luang Prabang

During the months we spent planning this trip, the one place that seemed to me to capture Joanne‚Äôs imagination the very most was Luang Prabang.  On many occasions she made comments like, ‚ÄúI am really excited to visit Luang Prabang‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI wonder if we are staying enough nights in Luang Prabang‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to be really sad to leave Luang Prabang‚Äù. Having not involved myself extensively in the Laos planning process, I wasn‚Äôt sure what the big deal was about Luang Prabong, but nevertheless my expectations were raised to a dangerously high level.

Luang Prabang exceeded our expectations, we didn‚Äôt stay enough nights, we were very sad to leave.

Lonely Planet refers to Luang Prabang as a kind of ‚ÄúShangri-La‚Äú, and it‚Äôs easy to see why: the town was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its well-preserved fusion of French Colonial and traditional Laos architecture, its geographical significance at the confluence of the Mekong and Nam Khan river, its political significance as the historical capital of Laos, and its religious significance due to the presence of over 60 active Buddhist temples.

(from Joanne: This place is so beautiful!  The old city where we stayed is on a peninsula between the 2 rivers, and the walk around the edge is magical.  Everywhere you look there is water, or beautiful Temples, or beautiful old French style buildings, and always tropical vegetation.  It is the greenest town we have visited since arriving in SE Asia.  You can tell that the local people appreciate the beauty, they tend the plants and sweep the streets in the early mornings.  And there are monks in their bright orange robes EVERYWHERE.)

It also has a French bakery reputed to have the best croissants in all of Laos.  (I evaluated this claim on three separate occasions.) (from Joanne: Every meal we had in Luang Prabang was amazing.)

Our days always began around 5:00am, (from Joanne: my day not our day; Philip opted for sleeping in after the first couple of days üôÇ )  when we would get out of bed, quickly make the first cup of coffee, and then retire to our room‚Äôs second story balcony to experience Tak Bat, in which well over a hundred monks would walk single file down our street in silence to receive offerings of food from the people.

(From Joanne: there were usually 3 women who, at 5:30 am, quietly unfolded mats, put down a cushion, and knelt on the ground in front of our hotel, waiting quietly for the monks, and then silently offered a ball of sticky rice into each monk‚Äôs alms bowl. It seemed like community bonding time between the women who would chat softly while waiting, and between the monks and the community‚Äìmonks relying on the community for their food, and the community for the blessings of the monks. Down the street I could see another woman giving food. Sometimes the monks would be also carrying a plastic bag filled with veggies or fruit.  I was so moved by the experience that I awoke at 5am every morning to bear witness to this beautiful experience).

The rest of the day was spent wandering around the town, checking out the Vats (Temples), and generally enjoying the very laid-back vibe of the place. On three evenings, we ate ‚ÄúLaos Barbeque‚Äù: a hot-pot kind of experience on real wood coals set in a stone pot in the middle of your table, where a metal soup like tin is set with a section on the top for your meat/tofu to grill and then it goes into the soup. See photo above.

On two occasions, we were lucky enough to see the sunset over the Mekong River, then walk directly into a temple to experience evening chanting.  I surreptitiously took a little video; here it is:
