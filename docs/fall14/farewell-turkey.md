To our amazement and dismay, we leave Turkey today.  The last three weeks have been an incredible cultural, gastronomic, and social adventure.

After a couple of days in Selcuk where we visited the amazing ancient city of Ephesus, we took a train and a plane back to Istanbul where we are staying in our first ever AirBnB lodging in the Taksim Square area.

Our new friend Verkin Arioba invited us once again to dinner, this time at her apartment in central Istanbul.  Yet another incredible experience: she has renovated a five story building left to her by her father in the “electrical district” of Istanbul, converting the first three floors into performance and production spaces for artists (Sumahan), and the top two floors into living spaces with incredible views of the Istanbul skyline. Coincidentally, a friend of hers from New Orleans was visiting, so we made a new JazzFest connection.  Laissez les bons temps rouler!

We have slowly become aware that Turkey is in a politically and socially unstable situation, and that despite tranquil outward appearances, people here do not enjoy the freedom of expression, assembly, and due process we take for granted at home. Joanne and I hope that they can find their way past this period to a better future.

We came across some street musicians playing a beautiful song on Istaklal Cadessi. Here is just a minute of it, captured with my iPhone:
