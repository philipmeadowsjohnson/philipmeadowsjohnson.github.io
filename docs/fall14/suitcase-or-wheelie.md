Wheelie is better much of the time. But how much is ‚Äúmuch‚Äù? And how bad is a wheelie the rest of the time?

Update:  Since my initial posting, Joanne has added a third option: a duffel bag.  As of two days before the trip, she has still not decided whether she will use a backpack, suitcase, or duffel bag. So, she‚Äôs taking the wheelie with a duffel bag inside to California, and then we will go to REI to look for backpacks.

Stay tuned for the astonishing conclusion to this weeks episode of Travel Wars: Wheelie vs Backpack. (Katie)

Clearly, I spend too much time on Facebook because I am miffed that there‚Äôs no way for me to ‚Äúlike‚Äù Katie‚Äôs comment (Beth)

Katie you are hilarious! (Jenna)

Do you expect you will be on foot and on rough surfaces a lot? If so, then backpack. If not, then wheelie. When we visited Ken‚Äôs son Alex in Panama for ten days. We knew that we were going to have to walk for 45 minutes into their village. A wheelie would have been unworkable. Backpacks get pretty heavy though too. But, you all are strong ‚Äì I‚Äôm sure you can handle it üòâ (Gillian)

Wheelie is DEFINITELY better than duffle. On a long trip I still vote for the backpack. Hands-free- effortless. I will never forget going to London a few years ago with my rolling duffle and using the steps (25-30 at a time) in the underground üò¶ UGH! Many stations in the underground are not the least bit accessible !! Of course I was traveling much heavier than you guys usually do . Just think the backpack will work out much better in countries like Turkey and Laos. Have a good time in REI.!! (Dale)
