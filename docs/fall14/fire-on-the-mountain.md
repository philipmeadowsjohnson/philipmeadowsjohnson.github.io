We just spent two absolutely delightful days in Cirali, a tiny little village on a two mile beach. The water here is turquoise, transparent, and so warm you have a hard time getting out of it once you’re in it. If you love Kailua Beach, you’ll love Cirali Beach.

Cirali is a 15 minute bike ride from the Chimaera, which is, as my daughters say, totally cray-cray. Basically, you hike up a hillside and come across a rocky area about 20 yards by 50 yards where at least a dozen flames spout from the rocks. The freaky part is that these flames are at least two thousand years old (this is known because Pliny the Elder wrote about them in the first century AD).  Even if you manually extinguish them, they relight themselves.  Legend has it that the first Olympic torch was lit from the Chimaera, which gives me new insight into the first line of Fire on the Mountain: “Long distance runner, what you standing there for?”

We spent our days biking around this tiny town (free bikes from the hotel, no locks, no worries!), dipping in the beautiful warm clear sea, and eating great food.  We love exploring these small Turkish coastal towns, traveling by dolmas (mini bus–think dolmas/stuffed grape leaves).  We have learned the following in Turkish: counting to ten, sort of to a hundred, “thank you” (3 different ways), “please”, “how much”, “where”, “very beautiful”, “delicious”, and “how are you?”.

In the past few days, our conversations have taken a subtle shift; in addition to talking about how totally cool Turkey is, we’ve started saying things like “when we come back to Turkey, we’ll have to…”.

What a wonderful experience you are having!!! The pictures are incredible and would make anyone want to be where you are, doing what you are doing! I love your reports, love knowing everything seems to be going perfectly so far. Thank you for the pictures and the comments. Keep it up because I know everyone agrees with me they are wonderful!!! Love you. Mother

Instead of calling this blog “Philip and Joanne’s travel adventures” you should call it “the analysis of the influence of the Grateful Dead on Turkey geography and culture… an visa versa” (Katie)

LOL! – Katie – you crack me up! And, totally, yes! 🙂 I never knew about these eternal fires – so incredibly cool! Turkey is a place I’ve wanted to go to since getting to know about Persian rugs from Anthony. The kilim rugs from Turkey are some of my favorites. So great to see these posts. Thanks for being so faithful in putting these up. (Gillian)
