In preparation for my sabbatical in 2014, I contacted a University in Bhutan and arranged with them for me to spend a semester teaching computer science in a remote western province.

Unfortunately, that plan disintegrated just two months prior to lift off when we learned that they would not grant a visitor visa to Joanne. They told me I could come to Bhutan and then apply for a visa for Joanne, and then they *might* grant it and allow her to join me.

We needed a Plan B, and fast. What we came up with was a trip around the world: from Hawaii to California to New York to Turkey to Thailand to Laos to New Zealand and finally back to Hawaii. I would give lectures at universities along the way as part of the sabbatical experience.

At the time, we created a WordPress blog as a way to letting friends and family know how the trip was going.  The following pages present our "dispatches" from this trip, and the comments that folks made as we travelled.
