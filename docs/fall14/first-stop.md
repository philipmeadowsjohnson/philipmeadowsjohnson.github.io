We took this picture from Cone Peak in Big Sur, California, after a “thrilling” one hour ride up the side of the mountain from sea level to 4,000 feet, followed by a relatively straightforward 90 minute hike to the summit.   This is only the most literal of the many peak experiences we’ve had in just our first few days on the road.

We locked our house up at 12:15pm to go to the airport on Tuesday, with our renters scheduled to move in at 1:00pm.  45 minutes to spare—not bad!  Arriving in San Jose at 10:00pm, we picked up a rental car and, armed with Jenna’s excellent directions and Apple’s totally terrible Map application, proceeded to get totally lost in the Santa Cruz mountains.  We rolled in to her house at 1:30am to be greeted by a sleepy but relieved Jenna and an excited but no-longer-a-puppy Andes. We saw Asa the next morning, picked some delicious apples from their garden, and headed off to Palo Alto for a delicious Indian dinner with Katie, Leo, Larissa and Michael, then down the coast to Santa Cruz to Larry, Rosemary, and Kalyani’s house for a night before driving to Big Sur the next morning for a night of camping.

Our Big Sur experience was beyond glamping: we parachuted in to an expertly established site at Kirk Creek Campground perched on the cliffs over the Pacific Ocean with literally dozens of humpback whales breaching, spyhopping, and blowing right in front of us.  Rosemary and her friends Alison and Danny are master campers and hikers (Larry, not so much) and we ate and slept luxuriously.  After the day hike to Cone Peak we drove back to Boulder Creek (this time not getting lost) and I am now typing this post from Jenna and Asa’s living room.

After the past few months of living in the future while we frantically planned and pulled all the various pieces of this trip together, the ability to now live in the moment is indescribably pleasurable.  There is a zucchini muffin in the kitchen that needs my attention so I will bring this to a close.  Katie and Leo arrive in an hour, Larry and Rosemary soon after, and we plan to spend our Labor Day weekend talking, eating, playing music, and lounging by the pool.  Then on to New York and new adventures!
