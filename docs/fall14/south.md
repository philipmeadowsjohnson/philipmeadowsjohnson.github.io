It takes a long time to get anywhere on the South Island of New Zealand. A distance of 100 km might take two hours by car as you go up and down and over and around the mountainous countryside. (from Joanne: ‚ÄúLeft Philip, left!‚Äù) Most bridges are one lane, requiring you to come almost to a halt to avoid (the extremely rare) oncoming car. Reaching some places, such as Milford Sound and Aoraki/Mount Cook, require a 1-2 hour drive down a dead end road.

Oh, but how this investment is rewarded! I could ramble on for hours about the places we‚Äôve been over the past two weeks, and you would soon tire of the superlatives: epic, awesome, exhilarating, majestic, incredible. And while Joanne took fantastic photos, they still fail to capture all the beauty of the moment.

So: come to the South Island and see it for yourself. Walk along the bluffs of Kaikoura, then stop to see Fur Seals at Ohau Point on your way to Golden Bay. Hang out for a few days in Takaka, and take a day trip north to Wharariki Beach where the winds can reach 100 mph and you can climb Pillar Point ridge to view the entire 30 mile long Farewell Spit. Spend time in contemplation at Waikoropupu, a sacred area to the Maori with spring-fed pools containing some of the clearest naturally occurring water on Earth (you can look, but you can‚Äôt touch.)

Make your way toward Wanaka, but be sure to stop and hike to Monro Beach where, if you‚Äôre lucky like us, you can see Fjordland Crested Penguins surfing the shore break onto the beach and waddling away to their nests in the shrubbery. Once you arrive, stay at the Lake Hawea Motel (we recommend Room 4) where the picture window looks onto a turquoise lake with the snow-capped Southern Alps in the distance. Hike the Rob Roy Glacier track, which (at the time) we thought might be the most epic hike of our lives. (from Joanne: Seriously gorgeous with multiple waterfalls, and glaciers calving in view of our lunch spot.  I could go on and on‚Ä¶)

You will have to tear yourself away from Wanaka, but do it for the long drive to Te Anau and the even longer drive into Milford Sound, home of the Milford Track, known for over 100 years as ‚Äúthe finest walk in the world‚Äù. On the drive into the Sound, try the challenging Marian Lake hike, a glacial fed lake through a hanging valley, with spectacular views where we saw (from Joanne: and heard‚Äìloud, thunderous)  two avalanches during our brief rest and PB&J sandwiches.

And be sure to save Aoraki/Mt. Cook for last. Because no matter how blown away you‚Äôve been by the South Island so far, the walk to glacier-fed Hooker Lake, along a valley surrounded by 10,000 foot peaks, to the foot of Aoraki, the tallest mountain in Australasia, will bring you to your metaphoric (if not actual) knees in gratitude for and wonderment at Nature.
