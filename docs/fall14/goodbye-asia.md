title: Goodbye to Southeast Asia
hide_table_of_contents: true
---

It‚Äôs really hard for us to believe, but our time in Southeast Asia has come to an end.  I have to admit that I anticipated this part of the trip with some trepidation (omg, you can‚Äôt drink the water!  Where will I find peanut butter! I am positive I‚Äôll have stomach problems!) Now that I‚Äôve been here a month, I can‚Äôt wait to come back: the people are so kind, the countryside so amazing, the food is incredible, and you can deal with the water (thank you Jenna and Katie for getting us the SteriPen!)

(from Joanne:  Philip did great here, I realized that I kind of dragged him here, a bit out of his comfort zone, and the best thing happened:  he didn‚Äôt get sick, and he fell in love with the place.  Not hard to do with Buddhas everywhere üôÇ)

## Vang Vieng

After leaving Luang Prabang, we took a six hour bus ride through the mountains of Laos to Vang Vieng.  This bus ride was intense: poor, narrow, curvy, cliffy roads, even poorer mountain villages, and incredible vistas. Eventually we made it to Vang Vieng, a small town frequented by backpacker/young people for ‚Äúadventure sports‚Äù‚Äîtubing, caving, kayaking.  We didn‚Äôt do any of that. Actually, we decided to go tubing one day, walked down to the rental place, found out we didn‚Äôt have enough money for the security deposit on the tubes, and on the way back to our hotel room a torrential downpour ensued which made us extremely grateful we hadn‚Äôt had enough money.

We did rent bicycles and ride out 8 km to a gorgeous waterfall.  (from Joanne:  Incredible bike ride on a dirt road up and down through a very rural area to the falls.  Gorgeous waterfall and pools that we swam in.  Even more fantastic were the butterflies there‚Äìmany varieties and so so many flying about.  A butterfly wonderland!)

## Vientiane

Another four hour bus ride took us to Vientiane, the capital of Laos. Joanne scored us a beautiful room overlooking a beautiful Temple with the Mekong River just beyond, right in the center of town.  I‚Äôve never been to a more compact, laid back capital of an entire country.

(from Joanne:  Fantastic Food here!  Love Laap Gai, a ground up chicken salad with mint, chilis, and other herbs.)

On Sunday, there was a festival at a temple, probably some sort of fundraiser. Joanne and I were walking around when suddenly we heard some mad bass lines emanating from across the courtyard.  We strolled over and encountered, I kid you not, a three piece Laos ‚ÄúJam Band‚Äù.

(from Joanne:  it was incredible!! and very cute to see not only the kids watching intently, but also the monks!  I immediately thought about JazzFest, and went over at their break to see if I could connect them.  Unfortunately, no English, and no Laotian, could not communicate anything but how great I thought they were and to thank them (in Laotian), but could not find out any FB page or any way to get them to JazzFest.)

Here is a minute of their music accompanied by views of the temple area surrounding the flatbed truck they used as their stage:

## Bangkok

What can I say?  Bangkok is huge. Bangkok is noisy.  Bangkok is crazy.  We spent three days there and it was hard for me to adjust.  What I can also say is that Bangkok has the best shopping, the best street food, and the most over-the-top temples of anyplace we saw in Southeast Asia.

For example, Wat Pho featured the ‚ÄúGolden Buddha‚Äù, a huge statue of Buddha which was not so remarkable until 40 years ago when some of the plaster surface chipped off and the monks discovered that it was actually 5.5 tons of solid gold (which had been covered with a coating of plaster several hundred years earlier to prevent invaders from carting it off.) (Yes, I did the math: this is about $200 million dollars of gold).  We also got to meet and have dinner with Kwan, the friend of Philip‚Äôs colleague‚Äìgreat fun to go out with a local girl!

I LOOOOOOOVE reading your adventures. Brings it all right back! I was wondering how much longer you‚Äôd get to enjoy Asia and when you‚Äôd be heading to NZ. Now I know! Worms are still going strong. I just distributed their lovely juice to all the thirsty plants in our house. (Tamara)

You will be glad to know that the chicken or beef laab is plentiful in Kailua (Dale)

I want to go to every place you‚Äôve described. Have you ended up anywhere where you thought, ‚Äúwe should have given this a miss?‚Äù (Beth)
