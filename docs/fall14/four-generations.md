We have spent the past few days on the East Coast visiting a new baby (Josefina!), a new boat (Tuf Duck!), and a nice amount of family (Beth, Amy, Juan, Doris, and Rob!) We have been at Beth’s house in Springfield, a day on the water in Patchogue, and tonight we head for Rob’s house in Manhattan for a rooftop barbeque.

Tomorrow we fly to Istanbul.  The trip has been amazing so far, and we have appreciated the ability to easily communicate with people when we get lost and to read signs, maps, and menus.   Joanne continues to try to figure out ways to reduce the amount of stuff she’s carrying, although she has already simplified to an incredible degree.  We both feel incredibly blessed and grateful to be on this adventure.
