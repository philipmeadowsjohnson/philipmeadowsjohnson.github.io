After two days on busses and an overnight in Ankara, the capital of Turkey, we have now settled into the town of [Goreme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6reme) in the Cappadocia region.  This area was formed from ancient lava flows and subsequent erosion, that is tailor made for carving out dwellings, which the ancient Turks have been doing for at least the last thousand years. Although Turkey is a Moslem country, this area was home to early Christians who spent a lot of time constructing tiny little churches in caves around 1000AD.  Also in the area are ancient underground cities, used by the Christians hiding from their many persecutors.  Many are over 7 stories deep.  ( They have tours to these, but after a somewhat claustrophobic experience in the crowded World Heritage Site [open air museum](http://www.goreme.com/goreme-open-air-museum.php) visiting church caves, I think we will pass on these.)

Modern Goreme is a tourist town where almost all of the hotels are embedded into the hillside, and our hotel, [Aydinli](http://www.thecavehotel.com/), is no exception. What has to be exceptional is the hospitality of the family who runs the hotel. Upon arriving, we were asked to sit down and they brought us freshly made lemonade to drink while they gave us an orientation to the area.   When we ask them about directions to various hikes, they invariably offer to drive us for free to the starting point. Yesterday we walked in and the family patriarch, Mustafa, asked us to sit down in the lobby while he got us drinks and then spent about a half an hour chatting with us about the history of the hotel. His father bought it 85 years ago and it was the family residence; he was born in what is now Room #1.

We’re going to spend the next few days hiking (Katie, this is amazingly similar to the hoodoos in Utah!) and eating.  We had our first Turkish coffee today. Not sure why we waited almost a week to have one; it is sure to be a daily ritual from here on out.

Agreed! BTW–LOVE the washing line–using it daily and thinking of you every time. Was so great to spend some time with you all. Much love (This is Joanne!)

You are having the experience of a lifetime and reminds me so much of the wonderful places in that region your father and I were privileged to see 20-30 years ago. Thanks again for setting it up so we can share it with you! Mother

What a cool guesthouse! How did you find it? I would love to go to Turkey. Seeing these photos makes me even more interested. Thanks! (Gillian)
