Over 30 years ago, in 1983, I spent 8 months traveling with Joanne in Europe, sleeping in caves and hostels, traveling via Eurail pass and hitchhiking, and paying via a very limited number of American Express travelers cheques.

I am happy to report that after our first month on the road, she remains a delightful travel companion (although I now lobby for credit cards, airplanes, and comfortable hotel beds.) She is fascinated by new cultures, works diligently at basic communication in the local language, and is unphased by the unexpected. She loves trying local food, perusing local shops and supermarkets, and talking with local people about their lives and interests. She loves to walk, actually much more than I do!

I can think of no one Iâ€™d rather spend these three months traveling with. I can think of no one Iâ€™d rather have spent the last 30 years with. Happy Birthday, my love, and hereâ€™s hoping we have 30 more years of both traveling and staying home together.

Happy, Happy, Happy Birthday, my darling Joanne!!!! Iâ€™ve thought of you all week, as I looked at your name on my calendar â€“ just waiting for today when you add another number to your vital stastistics!! What a lovely way to celebrate this one â€“ travelling around the world with the love of your life! You must know how much we all love you. Doris

Aaaawwwww!!!! How lovely! You two are the best. Here is to your enduring romance and friendship! I hope (and I also believe) that Ken and I will be able to report the same sentiments in 30 years! ðŸ™‚ And, happy, happy birthday, Joanne! (Gillian)

Happy belated, Joanne! Just looking through your blog to date after getting Phillipâ€™s invitation. Looks like youâ€™re having a fabulous time with plenty of unexpected great experiences. And how nice that you have the weather to enjoy Turkish hiking and swims (not bundled up with chattering teeth like us!). I look forward to checking in on you regularly. P.S. Worms are doing great.
