title: Kevin's cousins

My good friend and paddling crewmate Kevin Pilbrow is Maori and grew up in Northland, the region of the North Island above Auckland.  As soon as we decided to visit New Zealand, I asked Kevin for his recommendations, noting that we’d be renting a car and driving around.  Along with plenty of encouragement regarding our visit, he did bring up one issue which I recall him presenting as follows:

*“So, just be careful: if you’re driving in Northland and you see a No Trespassing sign in front of a road, don’t ignore it.  My cousins don’t take kindly to tourists going where they aren’t supposed to.  They won’t hurt you, but you might find your rental car turned over or set on fire when you get back to it.”*

*“Wow!!! OK.  Hey—what if I printed up a sign to post in our car window saying 'Friends of Kevin Pilbrow'”?*

*“Oh, don’t do that, mate, some of my cousins don’t like me very much either.”*

So (of course) we’re now in New Zealand, and (of course) we’ve obeyed all No Trespassing signs, and (of course) the people of New Zealand have been amazingly friendly and helpful to us. We spent four days in Auckland where, among other things, I gave a talk on Open Power Quality at the University of Auckland, we spent a lovely afternoon hiking around Rangitoto Island, and we drove out for some great walks along the Waitakere Coast.

(from Joanne:  We loved Auckland for many reasons: very walkable; beautiful parks and coastline/water/bays at just about at every viewpoint; adult touch rugby games in the afternoons at Victoria Park; great NZ wines; delicious Indian Food restaurants walking distance from our hotel; and we can read and speak the language!

The Waitakere coast is incredible, just 45 minutes west of the city.  We went there twice to hike around the giant Kauri and tree fern forests and see the incredible huge long empty beaches and cliffs as well as the amazing birdlife. The Gannett colony was fantastic. We also enjoy the very different bird sounds we hear when we are hiking, and my new favorite bird, the Tui.

The sand artist was another fantastic treat to see, whom we came upon quite randomly when we went to see the Gannet colony.  We watched him create a sand mural by running through the sand with a rake!  I was rivoted–could not leave until he finished with a victory run. )

Auckland is a wonderful city, I would go back in a minute, and then we went to Northland. I was totally unprepared for how beautiful, open, unpopulated, and pristine it is.  As just one example, on the advice of our PDF version of the New Zealand Frenzy guide, we found the Mahinepua Track, a one hour walk which NZF’s author breathlessly describes as “without understatement, the Best Scenic Track in Northland!” (Bold font from the book.)

I have too few data points to concur with his claim, but I can say that for the first time in my life, a hike almost brought me to tears. Pictures don’t begin to do justice to the experience of hiking up and down along this peninsula as gorgeous coves, black sand and white sand beaches, hillsides, and cliffs reveal themselves one after another.  You have to hike it to understand why he’s so hyperbolic.

(from Joanne: Northland: so so empty and spacious feeling. Green rolling hills dotted with cattle and sheep, the coast with clear water, long empty beaches, no people, no trash, pristine trails, and clean public bathrooms with TP! Two spectacular hikes: Mahinepua and Mt Manaia, the latter involving 1,089 steps to the top.  It was worth every step for the 360 views, and we were virtually alone on the trails and the tops.)

So beautiful! As I said on the phone, this blog is so compelling I want to visit every single place you’ve described. I know this is very mundane, but in your next post could you give us an update on how Joanne’s wheelie suitcase and Philip’s ranger rolling are working out? (Beth)

I agree with Beth.. I want to visit everyplace that you describe – maybe you both have a second career in travel writing! Any dept of tourism would benefit from your vivid descriptions and heartfelt reactions to the people and things you are seeing! Thanks so much for bringing us along in this way 🙂 And, thanks for including the birds in your description. I looked at that Tui – what a cool looking bird! Ken has done work in NZ (in Wellington). He lived in Australia for a year many years ago and still rhapsodizes about it. I get that experience of being in a place with unusual bird calls. When we were in Panama last January, we had daily experiences of “what *was* that?” Getting to be in a place where you see birds you’ve only seen on TV or in books is pretty thrilling (spoken like a true bird nerd, I know 😉 ) (Gillian)
