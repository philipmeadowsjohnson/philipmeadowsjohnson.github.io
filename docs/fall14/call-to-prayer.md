One of the many cool things we experience every day (in this case, five times a day) is the Muslim “[Call to Prayer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhan)“. Near the top of the minarets associated with each mosque are loudspeakers, and at prescribed times of the day the loudspeakers broadcast a kind of chant sung by the muezzin.  If you are an observant Muslim and you hear the Call to Prayer, you’re supposed to go the mosque to do your prayers (at least if you’re a man; women apparently can do them at home).

It is impossible to describe in words how ethereal and downright lovely the Call to Prayer sounds, so I whipped out my iPhone last night and made a fairly poor quality recording (where you can also hear a group of tourists laughing and joking during the call). [Here it is.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B39ynmXUoikYUFppSmFtZ0NBZWc/edit?usp=sharing)

Today we were on a hike and the Call To Prayer happened while we were on a high ridge overlooking two towns: Goreme and Cavusin.  We could hear the Call to Prayer being sung by two muezzin simultaneously, and while there was definitely some variation, we discovered that they both sang the long held notes at the very same pitch. (They must blow a pitch pipe or something before they start singing to make sure they’ll be in tune!)

In the old quarter of Istanbul, the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia mosques are so close together that the two muezzin do the Call to Prayer as a duet–one line blasts out from one mosque, the next line from the other mosque, then back to the first: an Islamic call-and-response!

Our culinary guide from Istanbul told us that most Turkish  people are not observant and so life on the street goes on seemingly without any notice of the Call to Prayer. But we have noticed men walking to and into the mosques after the call is chanted and that if we are in a restaurant that is playing music, they pause the music while the Call to Prayer is being sung.  That’s nice, particularly when (as it was last night for us) the restaurant is playing the Theme From Titanic on pan pipes.

I love hearing that recording. Its kind of soothing and a nice way to call a time out five times a day – just for one minute. (Gillian)
