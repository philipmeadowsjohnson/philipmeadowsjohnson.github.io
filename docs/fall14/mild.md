Our visit to Chiang Mai concluded with two epic adventures: the first outward, the second inward.

## The Samoeng Loop

The Samoeng Loop is touted as ‚Äúthe best 100 km ride in Northern Thailand‚Äù, and so Joanne and I woke up on Tuesday determined to rent a motorbike and spend the day touring the countryside. (I had visions of renting something that looked like [this](https://fall14.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/captain-america-chopper.jpg), but ended up with [this](https://fall14.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/mio125.jpg).) The route took us around Doi Suthep and involved city riding ([scary!](https://fall14.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/chiang-mai-traffic.jpg)), mountain passes (awesome), and temperate rain forests (almost like Hawaii).  Twice we passed elephants being ridden along the road. Joanne convinced me to take a 5 km detour almost straight up the side of a mountain pass to the tribal village of Mon Chong. Apparently the farmers used to focus on opium poppies, but the Thai government chose Mon Chong to experiment on ecotourism as a replacement for the drug trade, so now they grow vegetables that are bought by the government and also served in a restaurant at the summit of a mountain pass with drop-dead views. The experiment appears to be working: it was the high point of our day. Here are some photos from our ride:

## Meditation Retreat

During last week‚Äôs Monk Chat, we learned that they also hold a two day meditation retreat every week from Tuesday to Wednesday, so Joanne and I signed up. We met the other 30 newbie meditators at the MCU University campus on Tuesday afternoon, and to kick off the event a monk named ‚ÄúPhra KK‚Äù gave us a one hour powerpoint presentation on Buddhism and  meditation. That I found a Buddhist monk giving a powerpoint presentation (complete with animated gifs of Buddha) incongruous reveals my Western biases. Unfortunately, I am sorry to report that even a very intelligent Buddhist monk cannot prevent a one hour powerpoint presentation from becoming boring.

After that, we piled into several ‚Äúred car taxis‚Äù for a 45 minute drive into the countryside where the university maintains a beautiful meditation center. We changed into white flowing garments, were assigned same-sex roommates (I bunked with a young man from Scotland, Joanne with a girl from Argentina), and then gathered in the meditation hall for the first of several meditation sessions led by Phra KK. We learned that Buddhist meditation comes in two basic flavors: mindfulness and insight. While the retreat focused only on mindfulness meditation, we tried out a great many postures:  four types of sitting mediation, two types of standing meditation, two types of lying meditation, and six types of walking meditation. We also practiced indoors and outdoors, and had both ‚Äúguided‚Äù meditation sessions (in which the monk would lead us), along with ‚Äúfreestyle‚Äù sessions (where we could pick our approach and do it indoors or out).  There was a bit of chanting, which was fun, and pretty decent Thai food (Massaman curry!)

Tuesday‚Äôs instruction ended at 9:30pm, and we were advised to go to bed immediately because we would be woken for morning meditation at 5:00am on Wednesday.  This turned out to be the high point of the retreat for me: we closed our eyes to start meditating at 5:30am in the dark, and when we opened our eyes 15 minutes later, it was dawn. Simply magical.

Quite frankly, it is not too challenging to meditate successfully under such optimal conditions: away from your job and home, out in the beautiful Thai countryside, dressed in white, surrounded by other novices, and guided by a master practitioner. Any of you would do as well, and if you ever make it to Chiang Mai, I hope you will try it too!
