title: Philip gets a haircut

I knew my hair and beard would need maintenance during the trip, and decided the time had come when we arrived in the gorgeous seaside town of Kas.

*(Editor’s note: Joanne’s comments in italics.)  Kas is amazing–low key gorgeous, white houses up the hillside. Town dotted with little rocky coves outside the marina area that you can swim in beautiful clear water. Huge pedestrian only walking area around the Marina. Beautiful restaurants with views of the water and islands off shore. Very special place. Lots of barber shops!*

Since neither Lonely Planet or Trip Advisor provide sections on “Best barbershops in Kas”, the selection process was simplified: just walk into the first one that’s open.

*There are SOOOO many to choose from. Male Grooming is apparently huge in Turkey. It is interesting to note that I could not find a women’s salon to save my life.  Maybe has something to do with the headscarf thing. Philip’s good looking (emphasis here people) barber said there was a salon a few blocks away. Meanwhile, there are like 3 barber shops a block!*

I was a little intimidated by the whole thing so I asked Joanne to accompany me as my “wingman”, and I brought our phrase book so I could stammer out “just a trim, please” in Turkish. (This attempt got a big laugh out of both barbers, which was hard for me to interpret: did that mean they found my accent amusing, or was it the idea of limiting my experience to a “trim”?)

My barber turned out to be a good looking, *(!!!–recommend zooming in on your computers)*  22 year old who started learning the trade when he was 13 years old. His English was quite good so we had a lot of fun discussing my very first Turkish barbershop experience. I guess he decided to give me “the works”, because in addition to the haircut (which Joanne claims is my best haircut ever) and the beard trim (which was cool because he used a straight edged razor on my neck and cheeks), I received two treatments not associated with any prior haircut:

1. About midway through, he took out some sort of magic wand, lit it on fire, then used it to whack my ears and nose. I am pretty sure any errant hair in the vicinity was annihilated.

2. Near the end, he asked me to remove my shirt, then poured some slightly astringent oil on my shoulders, back, and arms, and gave me a rather muscular half-body massage.  (When he told Philip to remove his shirt I almost fell off my chair.  He did not do this for the guy before Philip mind you. What an experience!)

Here are some photos documenting the process.

This is great! (Rob)

Definitely a great haircut! (Is Berber the barber’s last name? Or were they also selling carpets? Or is it a misspelling on an otherwise perfectly spelled sign?) (Beth)

LOL! Joanne, I can imagine that must have been a surprise to hear the barber ask Philip to take off his shirt!!!! The description of the town sound marvelous! (Gillian)

Philip. I confess that I have been obsessed with your hair since the day you refused to let me cut it!!!!! Since that day, I have not seen your hair look so perfect (according to my idea of perfect!). I think you will be spoiled forever after such an extravagant treatment. Is it OK for the mother to say her son is movie star handsome? I know Joanne thinks so too. I loved reading about the experience and think this “barber” (magician) would be a big hit anywhere in the US!!! Love, Mother/Doris

I am definitely going to Turkey, for my next haircut!!!
