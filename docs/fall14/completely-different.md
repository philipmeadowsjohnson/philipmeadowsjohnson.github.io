From mosque to wat, from dolmus to tuk-tuk, from chicken shish to pad thai. What a difference 10 hours in a plane makes.  We are now in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and starting over with language, culture, food, and environment.

I have become deeply familiar with the feeling of “disorientation” during this trip: the effect of dropping into a situation where you don’t know the language, the people, the food, and the place. The first day, literally every step is novel, every moment is unfamiliar.  The second day, you can at least figure out how to walk back to your lodging, and say “please” and “thank you”.  Each succeeding day, more routines are established, and gradually the sights, smells, and sounds start to feel “familiar”. Do we return to a favorite restaurant because the food was so good, or at least in part because the experience will be predictable? In Turkey, it took me at least a week to begin to feel oriented.

In Chiang Mai, buddhist temples appear every few blocks.  We went to a “monk chat” one evening, where monks can practice their English and westerners can ask them about their life and Buddhism.  Yesterday, we happened upon Thailand’s annual national art exhibition in a gallery at Chiang Mai University. Check out the pictures I surreptitiously snapped of the children’s entries. Buddha is everywhere here, even in the imagination of elementary school children.

I am intrigued by your description of the disorientation. I can imagine how that would be a consistent feature of this trip -but think of all the new neural pathways you are creating! Its great for your brain health 😉 (Gillian)
