With so much natural beauty at every turn, you might wonder why we chose to stop at the Hamilton botanical garden. What if I told you the Hamilton botanical garden was [the best garden in the entire world](https://hamiltongardens.co.nz/news/hamilton-gardens-wins-international-garden-of-the-year/)?  We didn‚Äôt know that at the time, but lucky for us it was on the way out of Hamilton so we made what we thought would be a quick stop to have a nosy. (Note that ‚Äúhave a nosy‚Äù is Kiwi for ‚Äúhave a look around‚Äù. Joanne and I love this expression and try to use it at least daily.)

Wow. What a garden!  Or, more accurately, what a fabulous sm√∂rg√•sbord of gardens.  What makes the Hamilton garden special is that they created examples of different gardens across time and geography: a 10th century Chinese Scholar‚Äôs garden, a 19th century English flower garden, a 14th century Japanese contemplative garden, an 8th century Indian Char garden, a traditional Maori garden, and many more. Oh, and a 4,000 bush multi-variety rose garden which was entirely in bloom when we visited.

(From Joanne: Hamilton turned out to be an unexpected surprise in a few ways. We included it in our trip because Philip was speaking at the University of Waikato. We stayed at a motel directly across from Lake Hamilton (Rotoroa in Maori), a huge natural spring-fed lake with a beautiful wooded walking path around it which I jogged around daily. In general we are seeing incredible investment in public access to beautiful natural areas: trails, gardens, walkways, clean public restrooms, and general accessibility. While Philip gave his lecture, I spent the morning at the Waikato Museum which had a Maori weaving exhibit that almost brought me to tears. I really love it here.)

From Hamilton we drove south to Turangi for a couple days and then on to Lake Taupo.

(from Joanne: Turangi, a tiny town in a beautiful mountain lake environ, is famous for the Tongariro River which has a wonderful track/path along both sides with two suspension bridges, about 4 hours worth of hiking path. This being Spring, there are bright yellow broom plants blazing up and down the river and mountain sides. (Broom look a lot like Forsythia‚Äìwhich is what I thought they were until I asked a local woman). Surrounding the river are pasture lands with sheep and cows with mountains behind them. Beautiful!

The river itself is a wide rushing clear rock strewn waterway that makes Turangi the trout fishing capital of the world! And get this: you can‚Äôt find trout at any restaurant or store because it is illegal to sell trout in New Zealand. So the fish are huge and there are fly fishermen up and down the river flicking their lines. The limit is 3 fish per day. What a place!)

Another big draw in these parts is the Tongariro Crossing, generally considered the best one day hike in New Zealand. However, our trusty New Zealand Frenzy guidebook panned the hike as too crowded and recommended that we hike only the initial segment of the Crossing and then take a fork to climb a neighboring volcano called Mount Ngauruhoe (pronounced Nah-ooh-roo-hoy). So, after a drizzly day driving to Turangi, we set out the next morning under beautiful bright blue skies for a 45 minute drive to the volcano.

However, yesterday‚Äôs rain in Turangi was also a freak snow storm in Tongariro National Park, and as we got closer, we came upon surprising views of a completely white Mount Ngauruhoe. The parking lot had about an inch of snow, and the volcano was unclimbable even with crampons and ice axe (there were two small avalanches that morning). Following the recommendation of a park ranger, we hiked about 4.5 km along the trail to a spot called Soda Springs, by which point the snow was a foot deep in places.

(from Joanne: Lake Taupo: Here again there is a 10 km public walkway around part of the Lake with snow-capped beautiful mountains in the background. Lake Taupo is (we were told) the largest (by volume) lake in the world. Now if you come from Michigan like we do, you might have a problem with this claim, but we were told that Lake Taupo is over 1,000 feet deep. Well, we had to fact check this one, and actually Lake Taupo is dwarfed by Lake Superior. And get this: along the Lake Taupo walkway are steaming thermal vents making the lake warm and even boiling at some spots along the edges. The walkway has occasional ‚Äúdanger boiling water‚Äù signs! These thermal vents/springs are all over the place, and one was even under our motel, allowing them to pipe in water into private tub rooms‚Äìwhich we had the pleasure of soaking in. I love New Zealand!)

(From Joanne: I also want to mention the Aratiatia Dam, which stops up the Waikato River not far from Taupo. We got to see ‚Äúwater releases‚Äù a couple times from a few different spots along the river‚Äìfascinating. The releases occur on schedule 4X/day during the summer, complete with 4 timed warning sirens‚Äìand anyone who knows Philip knows how into this he would be. We went to a bridge site right by the Aratiatia power plant (hydro-electricity provides over 50% of New Zealand‚Äôs power needs) and watched the release blow down the river, and then came back for another planned release 2 hours later to view the release from the dam itself‚Äìso interesting. ( Ken‚Äìsaw my first New Zealand Fantail flying around at the second release üôÇ

I (Joanne) have been asked to say a word about the wheelie vs backpack debate: WHEELIE WINS! Hands down, I have been so happy with my wheelie bag. Maybe once for about 5 minutes a backpack would have been handier, but all in all the wheelie was excellent‚Äìfrom the ancient streets of Turkey, throughout Thailand and even in and out of the 2 day slow boat down the Mekong in Laos. Now that we are in New Zealand with a car, wheelie is totally rocking it. (from Philip: I agree!)

To conclude, a note about the title of this posting. New Zealand takes pride as the setting for the Lord of the Rings movies: ‚ÄúHobbiton‚Äù is a big tourist destination, and the Air New Zealand flight safety video features stewardesses in elven cloaks, hobbits bungee-jumping (?), and a cameo by Peter Jackson. While I am a big fan of the books (I read the hobbit+trilogy to Jenna and then to Katie when they were in elementary school), we made no effort to put Middle Earth on our itinerary. Even so, Middle Earth found us:  Mount Ngauruhoe portrays Mount Doom (although on the day we visited, it would have been a more appropriate lair for Saruman the White than Sauron the Black!

As usual, the photos are breathtaking and the descriptions just wonderful! I am looking forward to you guys getting home safe and sound and to being able to talk to you, but I am really going to miss this blog! And thanks for the wheelie update, Joanne. I think you should email that OneBag guy with your findings. (Doris ‚Äî LOTR stands for Lord of the Rings, and yes, I had to google it.) (Beth)

Agreed! Great descriptions and photos as always. I would have probably put ‚Äúthe shire‚Äù on my itinerary ‚Äì just for grins. I loved the books and the movies. Though I must say, the latest movie installment of The Hobbit is not up to par. When do you all get home? And, very exciting news ‚Äì Katie and Jenna are going to join us in CO for Thanksgiving! Mother, Rob and Beatrice are all going to be here too! (Gillian)

In the land of mordor where the shadows lie! Also: I would like to point out that you also read LOTR/hobbit to ME when I was in elementary. (Katie)

So sorry, Katie! I have edited the post to fix this oversight. Your Dad is getting old and forgetful. (Philip)

Yea for wheelies! Glad my personal endorsement turned out to be the official winner. I love seeing the scenery. Maybe there should be at least one more trip to NZ in my future . . . (Tamara)

When the two of you retire, I think you should contemplate a new career developing travel documentaries! I have enjoyed your blogs so much and am so happy you decided to do this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶what a treat to see your pictures and read your comments!! Thank you, darlings!!!! Mother/Doris

Find us a farm‚Ä¶.and we will all move there!! There are probably no Dead Cover Bands there, so we will have work‚Ä¶ Rosemary will garden‚Ä¶. Joanne will knit Wool sweaters to sell‚Ä¶.Now a name for the Band??? Uh‚Ä¶.‚ÄôMountdoom of the Moon‚Äô‚Ä¶Uncle Maori‚Äôs Band‚Äô‚Ä¶‚ÄôKiwi Roses‚Äô‚Ä¶.‚ÄôIt Must of Been the Kiwi‚Äôs‚Äô‚Ä¶.‚ÄôKiwi Doll‚Äô‚Ä¶.‚ÄôKiwicat Sunflower‚Äô.. ‚ÄòNew Zealand Caboose‚Äô‚Ä¶.‚ÄôNew Zealand Boogie‚Äô‚Ä¶..uhhhh????
