Our second day in Istanbul was filled, both  literally and figuratively, by the “[Born on the Bosphorus](https://culinarybackstreets.com/culinary-walks/istanbul/)” culinary tour. In six hours, we ate our way through three neighborhoods and made 14 stops at restaurants and food markets.  Our guide, Ugur Ildiz, was born and raised in Istanbul but spent 10 years in the US so he had a deep knowledge of both the Istanbul food scene and what we would find interesting about it. If calories combat jet lag, we took the best possible remedy.  We have about 30 pictures of the food so the above is just a tiny sample of what we ate.

Along the way, he helped us deal with “teşekkür ederim”, Turkish for “thank you”, a difficult to remember, six syllable tongue twister. He told us to say “Tea Sugar A Dream” really, really fast, and it will sound close enough for people to understand.
