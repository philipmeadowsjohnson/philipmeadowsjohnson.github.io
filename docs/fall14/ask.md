## Motorcycle Redux

Emboldened by our successful experience in Chiang Mai, we rented another motorbike in Chiang Rai and set out to see the Wat Rhong Khun, a.k.a. the “White Temple”. Wow.  Unfortunately, it was damaged by an earthquake earlier this year and we could only see the outside, but it was still amazing.

From the White Temple, we rode another few kilometers toward the Namtok Khun Kon national park along a country road when our bike began behaving strangely and we discovered the rear tire had gone flat. No problem, I thought to myself, I’ll call our guesthouse proprietor who arranged the hire, ask her to call the bike shop, explain the problem and our location, and have them bring us a replacement bike. I called, she called back after speaking with the shop, and the conversation basically went like this:

*“The bike shop says to get the bike repaired there, it will be quicker.”*

*“What? I have no idea where a repair shop is! How can I possibly do that?”*

*“Don’t worry. Ask the Thai people to help you.”*

In reality we didn’t need to ask the Thai people anything because they were already on the case.  Even before I was off the phone, a Thai family in a car going the opposite direction saw us by the side of the road, turned around, and asked us in broken English if we needed help and that a repair shop was further up the road.  Joanne walked into a small roadside shop who confirmed that help was close by. As we walked our bike along, various bystanders encouraged us on, pointing us in the right direction. Within a quarter mile we came across a small repair shop. I pointed at the rear tire, and 20 minutes later, we were on our way toward the national park.

The park was spectacular, with some of the largest bamboo I’ve ever seen and a gorgeous waterfall. (from Joanne:  the waterfall and rainforest were exceptional, but really the star of the day was the Thai people, who helped us in such a sweet and unassuming way.  Many lessons in this experience!)

## Cook Thai Yourself

We spent the next day attending a class called “Cook Thai Yourself“.  Our teacher, Tik, started by asking us what we wanted to eat. She guided us through a large market where we got some of the ingredients, then drove us to her house in the countryside where we picked more vegetables and herbs from her garden.  Along with Jude, a very mellow and nice woman from England, we made four things: Tempura Banana Flower, Pad Thai, Green Papaya Salad, and Green Curry with Chicken.

Tik turned out to be a real force of nature, (from Joanne:  this is an understatement–Tik was so fun and enthusiastic and hell-bent on us having a marvelous time.  It was fantastic.) and the food turned out to be incredible: best Green Papaya Salad I’ve ever eaten, and Joanne says the same for the Green Curry.  We got full after the first three dishes so Tik packed us a picnic hamper with rice, curry, plates, and utensils so we could eat later at the guesthouse!

## Saturday Night Fever

That night we walked through the Chiang Rai Saturday night market and came across a large plaza with a band playing Thai music and several hundred people dancing along. Each time a new song started, the entire crowd took off dancing with a new (fairly simple) dance step. We’d stare at the feet of the people near us until we figured out how the dance for that particular song went, then joined in.

(From Joanne:  I was encouraged on each different dance step with an occasional woman giving me the thumbs up or nodding and smiling at me when it looked like I got the step. Amazing how sign language can be so meaningful when you are limited in language. It was so fun.  I just loved the communal aspect of all going the same way, dancing the same step–there was something so cosmic about it and young and old enjoyed.)

Here’s a minute of Joanne dancing:
