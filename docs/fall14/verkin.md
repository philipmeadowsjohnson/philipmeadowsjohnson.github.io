While in New York, Rob put us in contact with Verkin Arioba, a friend who lives in Istanbul.  She invited us to dinner and so, last night, upon her recommendation, we took the ‚Äúslow boat‚Äù from the center of Istanbul up the Bosphorus for about 90 minutes at sunset to a small town near her house and a taxi the rest of the way.  An incredibly scenic beginning to a great evening.

The dinner was completely delicious and we also met her ex-husband, their two children, and two other guests from California.  We caught the last metro back to Istanbul at midnight.
