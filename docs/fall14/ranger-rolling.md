I did a lot of YouTube research this week on how to pack for trips.  I evaluated “[clown car packing](https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5UlxHsgD58)“, how [Martha Stewart packs](https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPRP-3GAn_0),  and several other less memorable videos, but what totally won me over was a series of videos on how to “ranger roll” your [shirts](https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so93nqxZLjM), [coats](https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drCw1--3Ko8), [pants](https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vCo65e6pxE), [socks](https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoHN4-0jw6A), and [towels](https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4KJqWGa7eM).  What makes ranger rolling so awesome  is: (a) your stuff doesn’t get wrinkled; (b) each item remains separate; and (c) each item is compressed into a small volume.

See the photo for all my clothes for three months ranger rolled.

Philip. No matter what your clothes look like after the first three days of travel, I am totally in awe of the way they look in this picture. Perhaps a shot of your clothes at the end of the trip would be interesting to see……. (Doris)

Dear Philip and Joanne – Are we to assume that your itinerary contemplates only warm climates? P.s. Can’t wait to inspect your luggage in New York . (Rob)
