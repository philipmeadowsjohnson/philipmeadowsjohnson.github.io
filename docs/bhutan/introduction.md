As you may recall, our trip to Turkey, Thailand, Laos, and New Zealand was the result of a failed attempt to spend a sabbatical semester in Bhutan.

In Spring, 2018, the East-West Center at the University of Hawaii put on an exhibit called "Bhutan: Gross National Happiness", which included the creation of a sand mandala by visiting Bhutanese Monks and a lecture on women in Bhutan which we attended.

Joanne and I walked out of that exhibit and decided then and there to figure out a way to visit Bhutan even if it meant visiting as a tourist.

We left in December for a two week visit. Here are the three emails we sent during the trip, followed by a longer essay that I wrote when we returned.
