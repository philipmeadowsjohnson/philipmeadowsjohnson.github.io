been back from Bhutan for a few weeks now, and I want to send you the above photo taken the day before we left. We are midway into a 2.5 hour hike up the side of a mountain to the Taktsang (“Tigers Nest”) Monastery, a spectacular place that is one of the most important spiritual sites, not just for the Bhutanese, but for Buddhists world-wide. The elevation gain is 1,700 feet in two miles, and you’re over 10,000 feet above sea level by the time you make it to the Monastery. Joanne hiked it almost without breaking a sweat while I huffed and puffed a few yards behind her for most of the way.</p><p>I also want to send you this quite lengthy email. While this trip has been profound for me in many ways, perhaps the most profound impact has been on my view of my home culture and its future. I’ve realized that I’ve had a fairly passive acceptance of the modern American economic/democratic system, because, warts and all, it didn’t seem like there were any compelling alternatives. As my late Father might have said to me rather gruffly, “Would you rather live in communist China?” Throughout my 60 years of life, I’ve felt grateful and lucky for the incredible First World opportunities I’ve enjoyed for education, travel, material wealth, leisure, and a work life where all I have to do to earn an extremely comfortable living is type at a keyboard and talk to groups of people in air conditioned rooms several times a week. So, given that my life has been so incredibly comfortable, doesn’t that say something profoundly positive about my culture?</p><p>As many others have observed, the answer to that is a resounding “No”: my middle class comforts result from an extractive and exploitive cultural and economic system. My epiphanies from this trip are that there are likely to be significant consequences for all Americans from this system, that it would be good to start preparing for those consequences now, and that the mainstream media are not only not talking about these likely consequences, they are literally in denial. (As a particularly egregious example, “Why 2018 was the best year ever!”, New York Times, Jan. 5 2019)</p><p>My friend Dale told me he wants to write a letter to his children and grandchildren apologizing for our generation’s destruction of the climate and the chaos it will wreak on their lives. Consider this a letter of apology to my children and grandchildren, along with some ideas for how we all might get proactive regarding some of the potential futures awaiting us in just a decade or two.</p><p>Before getting to that, I’d like to provide some context, so let’s return to Bhutan.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="from-padmasambhava-to-gross-national-happiness">From Padmasambhava to Gross National Happiness<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#from-padmasambhava-to-gross-national-happiness" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Probably the most popular meme regarding Bhutan is “Gross National Happiness” (GNH), a government policy which says that any initiative (i.e. build a new building on undeveloped land, cut down a tree in a forest that you own, build a new hydroelectric plant, etc) must be reviewed and approved by the GNH Commission, which will weigh the costs and benefits of the project with respect to “four pillars”: sustainable and equitable socio-economic development; environmental conservation; preservation and promotion of culture; and good governance. This policy has teeth. For example, one day we drove by an unfinished road up the side of the mountain and when we asked Sonam Tobgay, our guide, where the road went, he told us that it goes nowhere — a foreign entity had tried to build a private university but the project was found to be in conflict with GNH so the government stopped further development.</p><p>I believe that there’s something deeper going on in Bhutan for which GNH is more or less a natural outcome, as opposed to some revolutionary innovation in their thinking. Bhutan is a very small country (700,000 people, size of Switzerland) that’s been minding its own business between almost impenetrable jungle to the south and almost impassable mountains to the north for approximately 1,000 years. Bhutan has never been colonized, it’s successfully repelled the relatively few invading forces (Mongols, Tibetans, Indian rebels), and the fabric of life for a millennia has been completely entwined with the practice and development of a home-grown school of Buddhism. This is not just their religion and not just their philosophy, it’s also an integral part of their political and cultural history. For example, the “Great Unifier”, the person who brought the disparate regions together to form the political boundaries of modern Bhutan in the 1600’s, was a Buddhist Lama named Ngawang Namgyal. According to our guide Sonam, he did this mostly by persuasion, not force.</p><p>There are two core principles to Bhutanese Buddhism that in combination make it profoundly different from the dominant Western religions: non-attachment and reincarnation. Among other things, non-attachment informs the Bhutanese that happiness is not found through acquisition of material possessions, wealth, or power. Obtaining more than a baseline level of possessions, wealth, and power is admittedly seductive and addictive, but like nicotine or heroin, the desire for “more” leads to suffering, not happiness.</p><p>Reincarnation is not an abstract theoretical idea to the Bhutanese. One of their current Rock Star monks is in his mid-20’s and is recognized as a reincarnation of Pema Lingpa, one of their most important Lamas who lived in the 1400’s. Pema Lingpa is recognized as a reincarnation of Padmasambhava, the founder of Bhutanese Buddhism, who lived in the 700’s, who in turn is recognized as a reincarnation of the original Buddha, who lived in 500 B.C. The Bhutanese don’t believe that when you die, you are destined for heaven or hell or just decomposition. They believe that when you die, except in the cases that you achieve enlightenment or have been a really bad person, you get sent right back to Earth in 49 days.</p><p>So. Consider the existence of an entire (albeit tiny) country which has oriented itself for about a millennia around the ideas that (a) wealth and power are seductive but won’t make you happy, and (b) the way you treat your environment during this life does not merely impact your children and grandchildren, it affects YOU. It is in your own direct self-interest to leave your natural and social environment as good or better than you found it, because seven weeks after you die, you’re quite likely to be living in it again.</p><p>When I consider it from this perspective, Gross National Happiness is no longer anything revolutionary or innovative but instead an attempt by Bhutanese to put a modern, palatable, Western spin on an approach to life and governance that has been kind of obvious to them for centuries.</p><p>It is with these new thoughts and experiences whirling around my head that I’ve returned to America and re-immersed myself in my normal life, for which sustainability, resilience, and climate change are significant concerns. The collision has not been pretty.</p><p>Before I continue, I want to make it clear that I don’t believe Bhutan is some kind of magical utopian Shangri-La. They have significant societal problems just like every other culture. More important: Bhutan is the product of very specific and unique environmental and cultural features and is literally non-scalable. Other cultures and regions will need to find their own way out of the messes they’ve made. For me, Bhutan serves as an existence proof that human cultural evolution is not an inexorable progression toward some variant of the American economic/democratic system. In addition, it shows that there exists a (relatively) modern nation-state whose culture appears to be fundamentally sustainable and resilient. This is really good news for us as a species.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="trump-is-not-the-problem-climate-change-is-the-problem">Trump is not the problem. Climate Change is The Problem.<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#trump-is-not-the-problem-climate-change-is-the-problem" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Back to America. There are two attitudes prevalent among the liberal culture and media that I can no longer abide:</p><p><em>(1) “Trump is a blip, an aberration on the American political/social radar. If we could just elect a progressive Democrat in 2020, we can get back on the right track.”</em></p><p><em>(2) “Climate change is super scary. To do my part, I will commit to compostables, reusing my straw, installing solar panels, buying an electric car, etc.”</em></p><p>Let’s start with Trump. Being 60 years old has many benefits, not the least of which is a directly lived historical perspective. You know the old saying about how to boil a frog: just turn up the heat a little bit at a time and the frog won’t ever jump out of the pot? For me, Trump is a thermometer revealing that while the water is now close to boiling, the temperature did not just start rising during the last 24 months. Along with many others, I feel that our current problems are the culmination of decades of actions produced by the American capitalist/democratic system. I lump “capitalism” and “democracy” together because, at least in America, they are now synergistic, mutually reinforcing phenomena. Our media, wealth, and communities are products of American capitalism, which means the only viable candidates for national political office are explicitly or implicitly subservient to American capitalism, which means our democracy is only able to enact laws and carry out policies that support our form of capitalism.</p><p>I can hear my departed Father again: “And what’s so bad about capitalism, Dr. Philip ‘Karl Marx’ Johnson? You seem to have done pretty well for yourself under this system.” Well, the problem is this: American capitalism is designed around the idea that it’s a good thing for individuals and organizations to gain wealth and material possessions, but American capitalism does not require individuals and organizations to take into account “externalities”, which, to quote Wikipedia, are “a side effect or consequence of an industrial or commercial activity that affects other parties without this being reflected in the cost of the goods or services involved”. I want to highlight two important externalities: poor people (both within the United States and abroad), and burning fossil fuels (which produces climate change). I share the belief that the American capitalist/democratic system is the most powerful cultural system in human history, and that it is in a positive feedback loop of disenfranchising poor people and burning oil.</p><p>Many recent actions of our country, all resulting from the American capitalist/democratic system, provide evidence that Trump is not a blip that can be fixed by electing progressive Democrats. Three quick examples: Obamacare, Arctic drilling, and Fox News.</p><p><strong>Obamacare.</strong> From 2008–2010, the Democrats held the executive branch and both legislative branches. The signature result from Democrats having the votes to do anything they wanted is Obamacare. While I don’t want to minimize the advantages of Obamacare over what we had before, it’s important to be clear-eyed: the approach is so complicated, kludgy, and subservient to special interests that it might not even survive a single Republican administration. If you don’t yet believe we are frogs in boiling water, consider little old Bhutan, which has instituted universal, free health care (including all drugs) for everyone within the borders of their country including visitors. Furthermore, if a person in Bhutan has a problem that their medical system can’t handle, the government will fly you to a country with more advanced medical services and pay all associated costs. The Bhutan government finances free health care for all on a national per capita income of $3,000 per year. The US per capita income is approximately 20 times Bhutan’s. Let’s face it: The reason we don’t have universal, free health care is not because America can’t afford it. We don’t have it because our capitalist/democratic system makes it impossible for us to have it.</p><p><strong>Arctic Drilling.</strong> As you know, the current administration is moving to allow drilling for oil in the Arctic. This is really bad from a climate change perspective because we desperately need to stop burning fossil fuels, not look around for new sources of them. But what is more compelling to me about this move is that it makes no economic sense: renewables (solar, wind) can produce energy more cheaply than oil. So why is Arctic drilling still on the table? Perhaps it’s because our capitalist/democratic system is based on the premise that it’s good to accumulate wealth, and a few wealthy, powerful people will become even more wealthy and more powerful from Arctic drilling. The interesting thing about this explanation is that it implies that as long as someone accumulates wealth, the short or long term economics don’t matter. Nor do externalities. Please contrast this with Bhutan’s economic system. It is highly unlikely that Bhutanese organizations would ever even propose to drill in the Arctic; such proposals would never make it through the GNH Commission.</p><p><strong>Fox News.</strong> To appreciate the power of our current system, consider that it has created a major media empire (Fox News) that is literally Orwellian: according to PolitFact, approximately 50% of its statements are “false” or “mostly false”. Yet, its propaganda campaign is so effective that according to a poll by Research Intelligencer, 87% of Americans view it as a trusted media source. I now believe that significant action to address the root causes of climate change cannot occur in America as long as Fox News exists in its current form. Fox News is a perfect example of how mutually interdependent and reinforcing capitalism and democracy have become in America.</p><p>To summarize: I believe that Trump is a manifestation (maybe the nadir, although it’s certainly possible we will elect a President even worse than Trump) of our capitalist/democratic system. We could elect Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders in 2020 and while I will certainly put time and energy into electing a progressive, it won’t change our fundamental system, which is hell-bent on burning fossil fuels because, directly or indirectly, burning fossil fuels is the principal underlying engine of wealth creation in America in 2019. The personal beliefs of the President and/or Legislators, as well as the best available scientific evidence are impotent relative to the power of the system that elects them and pays them.</p><p>The global reach and impact of the American capitalist/democratic system implies to me that temperature rise will not be kept to 2 or 3 degrees celsius. Our planet will get way, way hotter, and no amount of street demonstrations or electing Democrats will change it. To me, the evidence is unequivocal: Our system and its underlying drivers are currently way more powerful than both our elected officials as well as the people who are enfranchised to vote for them, and the system wants to burn fossil fuels and keep them as an externality.</p><p>If this view seems incredibly depressing to you, I share the feeling. However, the silver lining is that I have a feeling that the current American capitalist/democratic system has only a small number of decades left. Perhaps I won’t live to see what comes next, but with any luck my children will. Before I return to that happy thought, let me first provide a quick reality check about climate change, because that’s also context to understanding what I think we should be doing to prepare for the future.</p><p><strong>Climate Change.</strong> My favorite summary of the impacts of climate change is written by, of all people, an investment banker. It’s called “The Race of Our Lives, Revisited”, by Jeremy Grantham, and it’s an extremely readable, 35 page essay. (See, by comparison, this email is positively pithy!) The net of it is that our future is going to involve far more than hurricanes, inundated coastlines, and billions upon billions of dollars of destroyed infrastructure. In addition, we’ll have almost 3 billion more people (a 40% increase), we’ll have lost 20% of global rice production and 20–30% of global arable soil, and large areas of land in the equatorial region will become uninhabitably hot, leading to millions of “climate refugees” seeking sanctuary in other countries.</p><p>As a technologist, the only place I think Jeremy gets it wrong is in his optimism about, well, technology. While it’s conceivable that someone like Katie will invent a gene drive for cockroaches that converts their entire population into carbon sequestration machines, I don’t think it’s prudent to place any hope on a technical Hail Mary. And no matter how economical solar and wind become, the American capitalist/democratic system ensures that at least a few very rich, very powerful people will make a lot of money from continuing to burn fossil fuels, which means that fossil fuels will continue to be burned. To me, it’s as simple as that.</p><p>Neither do I think that the rest of us, who are not rich and are not powerful, should placate ourselves by thinking that using compostables, installing solar, and commuting to work in an EV is “enough”, or even “all that’s possible for me to do” because we aren’t the rich and powerful.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="the-best-case-scenario-from-first-world-to-second-world">The best case scenario: From First World to Second World<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#the-best-case-scenario-from-first-world-to-second-world" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Here is perhaps the most problematic pill to swallow: I think our current American system is headed for collapse. I have a couple of reasons for thinking this, which I’ll summarize really briefly:</p><p>Reason 1: As long as we keep burning significant amounts of fossil fuels, the climate will continue to become more and more inhospitable to human life. As I’ve noted above, it seems likely that humans will continue to keep burning significant amounts of fossil fuels as long as the current American democratic/capitalist system is in place. So this line of thinking leads to only two possible outcomes: either the earth eventually becomes completely inhospitable, or the American democratic/capitalist system finally breaks from the environmental, political, and social problems created by more and more climate change. I think the latter is more likely (which is way better than the first alternative). To put it another way, maybe you can’t indefinitely keep externalities off the balance sheet. It might take a century or more, but maybe the exploitation of poor people and of the Earth has to be eventually converted from an externality into an expense, and as soon as that happens, it’s hard to see how the American system stays viable.</p><p>Reason 2: Human societies actually collapse pretty regularly. This is not very comforting, but it’s true. For an extensive discussion, I recommend the book Collapse: How Societies Choose To Fail or Succeed by Jared Diamond. Once you read about the collapse of various human societies that lasted way longer than the USA’s paltry couple hundred years, and that changes in environmental conditions is a common precursor to cultural collapse, it becomes much easier to acknowledge that this may well be the direction we are heading.</p><p>So, if a collapse of the current American capitalist/democratic system is coming, what form will it take, and what can we do now to prepare for it?</p><p>I think that how we should prepare depends on the form of the collapse. At one extreme is annihilation due to war involving nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. In that case, game over, and no sense planning.</p><p>A more optimistic prediction is a “Soft Landing”, where the collapse involves a few years of cultural, economic, and social chaos, from which emerges a new cultural system in which (at the least) burning fossil fuels is no longer an externality.</p><p>“Soft” does not imply “lacking hardship”: the Years of Chaos will likely include widespread death, famine, and civil unrest. But in the best case, they could lead to the deconstruction of America into autonomous, self-sufficient, small regions with a “Second World” standard of living.</p><p>The great news is that modern Bhutan demonstrates that a sustainable, resilient region can exist with a Second World standard of living in which society is devoted to increasing the happiness of its citizens. Despite (or indeed because of) climate change, our grandchildren have the possibility of becoming happier than we are!</p><p>Before I get prescriptive, I want to admit that my prediction regarding the future is definitely wrong, because the future never ever turns out exactly the way anyone predicts it. But it’s hard to confront the science regarding climate change in combination with the actions of our political leaders and not come to the conclusion that our society is headed for qualitative change. Maybe our future will be “softer”, maybe it will be quite a bit “harder”, but it seems foolhardy to not expect it to be a lot different.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="for-my-children-what-to-do-now">For my children: What to do now<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#for-my-children-what-to-do-now" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>First off, continue to do what you’re currently doing. Work to elect progressives. Recycle, install PV. Buy that electric vehicle. While none of these will do anything significant to address The Big Problem (i.e. climate change), they can make a significant impact on a number of really important secondary problems: social justice for women and underrepresented groups, pollution of the oceans, development of alternative power generation technologies, etc. Working on these causes will help you develop a personal network of people who are pro-active about trying to solve societal problems in a sustainable, progressive way. These are the folks you will want to know and want to turn to when the Years of Chaos arrive. The more of them you know, and the more experience you have working together, the better off you’ll be.</p><p>Second, to minimize the negative impact of the Years of Chaos, you and your personal network would be well advised to develop a portfolio of “Second World Skills”. By this, I mean the skills required to create and maintain healthy food, safe shelter, sufficient clothing, education, and good health in a radically localized and autonomous economic system. It might be prudent to plan that during the Years of Chaos, electricity will be scarce, mostly difficult to generate, and available only intermittently. Same goes for the Internet and telecommunications. There might not be stores like Costco with pallets of water or Whole Foods with 30 varieties of frozen ice cream. In Hawaii, cargo ships with food and supplies might arrive infrequently or not at all.</p><p>The good news is that we’ve still got at least a decade to prepare for the possibility of Years of Chaos. That’s plenty of time for all of us to develop a useful Second World Skill with only a very small weekly time commitment. Think of it like a hobby! Go volunteer at Habitat for Humanity and learn basic carpentry. Create a backyard garden and figure out how to reliably grow non-trivial amounts of food. Raise chickens (no resident roosters, please, be considerate of the neighbors). Take a course on First Aid, or get more advanced medical skills. Learn how to hunt or fish safely, responsibly, and sustainably in your immediate region, and learn how to prepare, preserve, and eat whatever you kill. Learn where your water currently comes from, and start to think about how your community could obtain safe drinking water if the grid goes down. It might also be prudent to learn some basic self-defense skills.</p><p>Once you have a Second World Skill under your belt, figure out how to spread that knowledge around. Maybe create a local workshop or or meetup around the skill. Build a website with informational resources. Just try to make sure that crucial knowledge for the skill will be available to you and others who want to learn it via a non-electrically dependent knowledge repository (i.e. a PDF that can be printed to paper, or the alternate format known to old people as a “book”.)</p><p>I hope that the better prepared communities are, the shorter the Years of Chaos will be. And I hope that in the best case, they can be a bridge from our current unsustainable and exploitive economic system, in which a few people are becoming astronomically wealthy at the expense of billions of others, to a collection of new, small, regionally-specific cultural and economic systems which are designed to prevent gross inequality, preserve the environment, and guarantee everyone a reasonable amount of food, shelter, clothing, education, and health care.</p><p>The specific social and economic structures for these new regional systems will depend upon the particulars of their culture and history and people. What will work for Oahu, Hawaii will be really different from what will work for Bellingham, Washington. That’s fine: I believe there can be many different solutions to the problem of a sustainable and resilient community. And I know now that this is not some utopian fantasy; it already exists in at least one place on our planet today. To see it for yourself, you just have to find your way through almost impenetrable jungle in the south, or almost impassable mountains in the north, or (if you’re lazy like Joanne and I), you can just hop on a Druk Air flight to Paro, Bhutan.</p><p>Tashi Delek,
Philip</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="comments">Comments<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#comments" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><em>I decided to circulate this essay beyond immediate family to friends and colleagues. Here are some of their responses.</em></p><p>I enjoyed your reflection, and especially the up-to-date description of Bhutan. I don&#x27;t really have much to add (at the age of 79_, except that the climate crisis is going to create great chaos and hardship for us Americans and all sentient beings on the planet. Out of that, human beings will either find new and hopefully wiser ways to survive, or they will disappear from the earth, which will be much changed. Meanwhile, those of us with a Buddhist perspective will continue to make an effort to cultivate equanimity, compassion,  loving-kindness, and wisdom as best we can in changing times and conditions, as we face ever-increasing crises. (Niki Miller)</p><p>I appreciated your essay about Bhutan, climate change problems, the results if we do nothing, &amp; ways for our children to prepare for the aftermath. I agree the product of society based on consumerism is not the way to live &amp; results in unhappiness - why I’m attracted to Buddhism. I’m fearful of the direction people of Earth are heading. But, I understand knowledge is a true power. Thanks for yours. (Desiree Brint)</p><p>Thank you for sending reflections on your trip to Bhutan. What your essay did was to get me thinking and researching more on climate change. I have been a dis-engaged Buddhist and am waking up to the world through the issue of climate change. Washington has failed us but there are many communities, cities and businesses across America that have awakened to a new activism. Hopefully more will become active (like me) as people gather to discuss visible signs like the rising sea level and extreme weather we’ve been experiencing.Your scenerio provides interesting possibilities(with the caveat that it is totally wrong): breakdown of the economic/political system, followed by chaos then reconstruction into something new. Others have said the future is totally unpredictable, like nothing we’ve ever experienced, impossible to envision. Anxiety and depression will be on the rise and stress reduction techniques in the form of meditation, or drugs are surging in usage. I agree that we need to band together for material, skills sharing and psychological support. Meditation goes out the window when things get really chaotic but a positive attitude, an open mind and goodwill and the willingness to cooperate in a group are essential. Here is where Buddhism can play an important role and practicing now one can develop and strengthen these important skills. We can build a resilient individual and resilient community both internally and externally - one that is prepared for climate change. (Margery Hamai)</p><p>Thank you so much for sharing this piece. I know it took me a while to respond, but I thought a lot about it. In fact, I&#x27;m increasingly sure this is the sort of thing we should all be talking about much of the time. Have you read &quot;Deep Adaptation&quot;?  <a href="https://www.lifeworth.com/deepadaptation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.lifeworth.com/deepadaptation.pdf</a> I&#x27;ve been meeting weekly with one of our students and she has been exposing me to the work of the author and others who are calling for an honest conversation, self reflection, and action around the likelihood of near term societal collapse. I&#x27;m trying to figure out what that means for me, both professionally and personally. It&#x27;s really, really hard.  (Aurora Winslade)</p><p>Very well written! I’m glad we got to see you guys rock out before chaos ensues🤪. I feel like this write up should be a requirement for all humans to read. I’m going to keep learning new skills and definitely pass them on to river. Kids these days just want to play video games. It’s sad. We are very restrictive with River. Go climb a tree instead. Looking forward to the bday festivities. Keep shedding the light! (Boogie Parlow)</p><p>Thanks for sharing your deep reflections with us.  The issues you are naming are on my mind and in my heart every day.  Next week Steve and I will be at a gathering in California that brings together spiritual leaders, entrepreneurs, investors, indigenous leaders, tech wizards and others who are committed to facing these burning issues of our time head-on, coming from a place of love.  Everything and everyone is connected.  We’re all in this together, whether we know it or not. (Elizabeth Keller)</p><p>I finally took a few minutes this morning to read, what honestly has been the most truthful and insightful read so far in 2019. Thank you for sharing your insights gained and experience. I absolutely agree with you 100% and having a one year old now makes me want to prepare even more for the future. We should all do dinner soon, I would love to discuss more. In my line of work I see first hand what is happening to the oceans, and even though Hawaii is relatively pristine compared to some other places, I am fearful that our ocean-protein sources are not long for this world. At least we know, in a new world you can bring light and joy through music! (Carlie Wiener)</p><p>Nice to hear from you again. I loved your essay also. Craig and I honeymooned in Bhutan with a Lama friend of ours in 2011. Pretty cool place. And since going, I&#x27;ve learned of some pretty devastating oppression of Nepali refugees there...as you note in your piece, it&#x27;s definitely not perfect. But inspiring in many ways. (Devon Hase)</p><p>Thank you for sharing your Medium piece.  We do, indeed, seem to be on the same wavelength in many ways. Since drafting my essay on Trump as ecowarrior, I have realized that I need to sharpen my own muddled thinking about economics.  As I mostly listen to audiobooks from the Hawaii State Public Library these days, I recently listened to David Graeber&#x27;s Bullshit Jobs, and I am contemplating re-listening to his Debt, the First 500 Years.  I am currently listening to Paul Mason&#x27;s Postcapitalism. Eventually, I&#x27;d like to think about how an anarchist (autonomist? - see the Health Autonomy podcast <a href="https://health-autonomy.fireside.fm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://health-autonomy.fireside.fm/</a>) social medicine might look like. I agree with you that the Years of Chaos are not too far in the offing.  Our three sons are 23 to 28 years old.  After we had seen Mad Max Fury Road and Jurassic World together back in the summer of 2015 at the Mililani multiplex, I asked Kyle, our youngest - when it becomes Mad Max times, &quot;so will the survivor be the Mel Gibson-like tough guy or the nerdy guy who rigs together the flying machine?&quot;  For his part, Kyle agreed that it&#x27;s gonna be a rough patch, but that a few humans will survive.  Ah, the optimistic blush of youth, I thought.  Just you wait until you&#x27;re as old as I am, and you&#x27;ll be just as pessimistic and cynical as your old man. As you suggest, however, it is incumbent on us to &quot;develop a personal network of people who are pro-active about trying to solve societal problems in a sustainable, progressive way.&quot; All the best, (Seiji Yamada)</p><p>Thanks for your essay, Philip.  I agree with everything you say, except for using the word “democracy” to describe our political system.  America shifted from representative democracy to representative plutocracy some time ago, hence all our problems.  A nice expansion of the points your essay is “The Great Turning” by David Korten. (Mark Hixon)</p><p>Philip, I enjoyed your essay. Going to Bhutan is one of my dreams!  (The bigger dream, of course, is having some element of GDH or something like it right HERE.) My online course is focusing on core concepts in sustainability this week, and Sustainable Economics being one of them, I have shared your link on one of our discussion boards. I appreciate the thoughtfulness of your writing, and how you express truths that can be terrifying in a gentle way.  I like your idea that the Years of Chaos could be followed by a different kind of society that will be the &quot;sustainable world&quot; that we are all trying to stumble towards. I say this sometimes vis a vis the university. I try to think about what today&#x27;s students will need in the future and how could we build in the Second World skills that you describe into courses or extracurricular activities or Outreach; start making connections to those teachers in the community and showcasing that type of learning and skill.  (Ask Matt...I like to say &quot;Students are going to need to know how to skin a goat&quot;).  But of course, I only say that in trusted circles, and you have said it so much more eloquently.  Thanks for sharing.  And for writing!  (Krista Hiser)</p><p>Philip, Very Well thought, Felt and Written!!!   A couple of questions: Is Being a Guitar player a “Second World Skill”? Have you thought of Running for Office?   I am not kidding…….You have a Clear, Positive (except for the “Years of Chaos” part)  and populist message….You are the Kind of leader, we could get behind….You are like a Young, very well educated, Christian/Bhuddist version of Bernie Sanders!!! Anyhow….Know that you are loved, not alone (Krewe De Aloha), and appreciated (by me!!!).. Thanks for the Thoughts and Inspiration!!! Love, (Larry) P.S. How can the Banana Slug Band be more effective???  I dont think Kids could grasp a song about the Fall of Capitalism(Although when we sing, ‘This Land is Your Land’…they all know it)…….Really, How can we Help????</p><p>Philip - I don&#x27;t  know what to say - you&#x27;ve kind of caught me off guard. Although I have similar feelings at times (perhaps from my 60&#x27;s experience), I  need further time to process.  I assumed that this trip would have &#x27;brightened&#x27; your perspective on humanity rather than dimmed it.  Therefore, I&#x27;m tasking the Amberg/Johnson GNHC to explore options on what to do to turn the tide; maybe offer feedback on additional corrective actions on improving our (others) happiness.  (and it&#x27;s not just not another 5oz of wine) (Alan Amberg)</p><p>Hi Philip, Wow, what an essay! Great that you put it all down for your Wider Public. I&#x27;m not sure I agree that capitalism and democracy are completed wedded; I&#x27;d like to think a democratically elected government could, and may in the future, choose to turn away from capitalism toward something more equitable, but for sure the capitalist side of the partnership has brought us to a dangerous place for the wrong reasons. I think your ending point and elaboration on the Second World Skills is more uplifting than the end of our conversation over dinner. So I am encouraged to dwell there and seriously ponder what skills I want to acquire and enhance. Thanks for the push on that front and the new year is an excellent time to start! (Tamara)</p><p>Philip:</p><p>I read the entire email (essay) straight through starting at about
12:15 am Sat morning.  I was wide awake.  First reactions:</p><ol><li><p>The lead picture is amazing.  If I died, I would want that presented as the photo of me.  The depth, color and richness of that photo is incredible, and the looks on both your faces fit into the landscape in a beautiful way.</p></li><li><p>As I read through your essay the feeling that developed was this: You and I are out swimming or chopping wood or doing some other immersive and strenuous activity. Each paragraph is like a pause in that activity where we came up for air or a rest and you breathlessly present a new thought to add to your argument or highlight a previous point. I could not get a word in &quot;edgewise&quot;.  Overall, the pace was breathless with a relentless momentum but which often seemed to have no clear destination in mind.  I kept thinking where does this end up. I am sure all that I have said here in point #2 is somewhat the result of how this work developed where one idea stimulated another and another and so on.  I do not mean to say that I disagree or am not interested, it just seems a bit breathless...</p></li><li><p>Despite the breathless pace, I agree with most of your observations, but feel like you missed an important point that is clear to me, perhaps largely as a result of my personal experience. You refer frequently to the US economic system with its wealth accumulation goal, our failing government and how things might end up in the future. However, I think you miss an important point with respect to the incredible importance of the US. The US inherited its economic system from the western Europeans who colonized the Americas. Indeed, both you and I are descendants of western Europeans as were our parents, so it is only logical that our parents can be quoted making comments such as your father&#x27;s in support of our inherited capitalist economy.  Ultimately, like all children we were brainwashed into our parents&#x27; system. The natural wealth of our land and our fortunate race, socio-economic class and time in history allowed us, and others more aggressive than us, to very effectively take this inherited concept of wealth accumulation, private property and exploitation of natural resources and create a GIGANTIC SPECTACLE that shines like a bright star within our atmosphere. This intense light on the horizon penetrates into every locale around the world - in many cases outshining anything else available in such places. This bright light is universally attractive to people who have less and struggle for life&#x27;s necessities; it exerts an incredible attractive force. Everyone wants the icons of this western life style and the wealth to achieve them. Only insular cultures like Bhutan with no colonial past and careful centralized control of societal inputs are able to resist such an attractive force. In this way the American (Western European) culture, economy and means to achieve it have spread around the world. This has created a world full of exploiters using up whatever natural resources they can get their hands on, competing for wealth, and nrelentlessly yearning for the icons of western life.</p></li></ol><p>The climate change challenge then becomes finding a way to transform this bright light on the horizon into an infinitely sustainable &quot;green glow on the horizon&quot;. If the US can achieve this, it will be of incredible international significance. The effect will be felt worldwide as long as our cultural icons (Hollywood, CocaCola, the fashion industry, automakers, advertisers, etc) buy into it and &quot;sell&quot; it to the world. To me this is the ultimate message and way forward for our children, grand-children and great-grandchildren. Our generation needs to start this transformation, in order for the world to still be a habitable place for them to live.  If we fail, I really don&#x27;t think the type of government or leaders we have will make a difference, we need a full on transformation of our societal goals.</p><p>Clearly, the challenges are great and are much more than personally composting, buying PV&#x27;s and EV&#x27;s or even electing progressive leaders. These are all great first steps and will help, but how do we take the brightness out of the light?  How do we reverse generations of brainwashed people who worship consumption, wealth accumulation to achieve more consumption, and in the process pollute our planet into oblivion. For the most part we do not even know we are brainwashed.</p><p>I distinctly remember coming home after 4.5 years in PC in Africa and seeing US culture as a continuous process of brainwashing.  At first, I thought something had changed and that others around me at home were also sensing the same thing. However, pointing it out to anyone, quickly made me realize I seemed to be the only one seeing the brainwashing. If found that if I pointed it out, it either pissed people off, or I was treated like a nut. Eventually, I just shut up about it, but I have never stopped observing it.</p><p>I think much of the message in your essay expresses characteristics and frustrations that ultimately equate to your realization that an economic and societal transformation is needed, and your Bhutan experience allowed you to see this with new clarity.</p><p>Much Aloha, Dale</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"></div><div class="col lastUpdated_mt2f"><span class="theme-last-updated">Last updated<!-- --> on <b><time datetime="2021-12-14T20:17:17.000Z">12/14/2021</time></b> by <b>Philip Johnson</b></span></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/bhutan/bhutan3"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">« <!-- -->Greetings from Bhutan, Part 3!</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/music/east-west-journal"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">East-West Journal (1979)<!-- --> »</div></a></div></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">No rights reserved</div></div></div></footer></div>
