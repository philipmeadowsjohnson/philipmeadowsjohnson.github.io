Aloha family,

One afternoon in Punakha, we crossed a prayer flagged-adorned foot bridge, hiked through fields where rice is planted in Spring, past cows, and up a hillside to a temple that was built about 15 years ago to commemorate the coronation of the current King of Bhutan and with the hope that it would help Bhutan be safe and prosperous into the future. The temple is several stories high. The ground floor is filled with sculpture and iconography representing the spirit and animal world, the second floor represents the human world, the third floor represents heaven, and when you climb up the final staircase, you arrive on the roof with a shrine to Buddha which represents Nirvana and has spectacular views of the surrounding valley and mountains.

When we descended to leave the temple, we found a small selection of religious items for sale including prayer beads (108 small sandlewood beads which you use as an aid to meditation). I have some at home, but neglected to bring them, and thought they would be a nice momento of our visit. Our guide Sonem said these were pretty good prayer beads and had been blessed by the monks, but for them to reach their full spiritual power, it would be best if we could find a Lama (a high ranking monk) to bless them specifically for me.

A few days later, we went to visit the "Burning Lake", a very holy site for Bhutan with a very interesting back story which, to keep this email manageable, I will not relate.  There is a shrine beside this lake with butter lamps, a place to burn incense, and an area where you can put tsa-tsas (small ceramic cones with spiritual meaning) and other offerings. We discovered to our dismay that there were no matches at the shrine, nor did we bring any with us, so it looked like we were going to have to leave the Burning Lake without being able to perform any kind of ritual.

Just then, a family of about 6 plus a nun and an elderly Lama came walking down the trail. Sonem chatted with them and learned they had arrived to perform a longevity ceremony for their family. Then, to our delight, they invited us to hang out and participate in the ceremony with them. In the space of a couple of minutes, we went from no matches to full-on Buddhist ceremony with a chanting Lama, burning incense and oil lamps, offerings of tsa-tsas, and hoisting of prayer flags on the hillside above the lake.  Sonem asked the Lama if he would bless my prayer beads, and he agreed, so that was the icing on the cake.

After the ceremony was complete, the family asked us to sit with them and enjoy some butter tea and saffron rice on the hillside.  (Joanne noticed that the Lama was offered, and accepted, a beer after his butter tea!)

 A half dozen photos are attached to help you visualize the day. It was epic.

Love
Philip and Joanne
