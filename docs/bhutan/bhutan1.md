Aloha family,

Joanne and I are tucked into bed in Thimphu and I wanted to quickly write to tell you we are alive and very well. Because of a cyclone in India, Thimphu got a surprise snowstorm today that led to the government declaring a holiday to keep people off the roads.  Thimphu only gets snow once every couple of years, and this was the biggest snowfall in five years according to our guide.  Everyone was so happy: we saw policemen taking selfies and starting snowball fights with each other on the street. Tomorrow it is supposed to be sunny and in the 50's, so all the snow will melt and things will go back to normal.

This is our fourth day in Bhutan and so far it has exceeded our expectations in every way.  While we have visited other Buddhist countries before (Thailand, Laos), Bhutan really takes it to another level.  Our experience is heightened by the presence of an amazingly knowledgeable and friendly Bhutanese guide.

I attach a few photos.  One looks out our hotel window and you can see the central square in Thimphu. If you look closely, on the far hill side, you can see a statue of Buddha. This statue was started in 2009 and is currently the tallest Buddha on earth (177 feet high). A second photo shows Joanne and I at the base of the statue. You can go inside into a temple room where there are 125,000 small (6" high) Buddha statues. I assume that also holds some sort of record (highest density of Buddha statues?), but didn't check.  Photography is strictly forbidden inside all temples in Bhutan, so you'll have to come here to see it for yourself!

Will email more later.

Love
Philip and Joanne

Startlingly beautiful is the phrase that comes to mind! Thank you so much for sending this dispatch! (Gillian)

Great to hear from you and to know that your trip is even better than you imagined. I really, really appreciate any time you can spare to share highlights like these. I will probably never get to Bhutan so traveling vicariously with you is a treat. (Beth)
