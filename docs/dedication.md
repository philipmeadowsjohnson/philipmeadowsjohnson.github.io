The combination of a pandemic and my first grandchild got me thinking about my own mortality in a new way. What would I want my kids to remember about me in 20 years?  What would I want my grandchild to know about me if I were to die next year?

It seemed ironic that I've put so much effort into organizing my [research efforts](https://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu), and so little into organizing the things I've done that are actually significant to my loved ones.
