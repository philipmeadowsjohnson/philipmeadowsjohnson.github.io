The combination of a pandemic and my first grandchild got me thinking about my own mortality in a new way. What would I want my kids to remember about me in 20 years?  What would I want my grandchild to know about me if I were to die next year? What do I want to remember about me as I descend into senility?

It seemed ironic that I've put so much effort into organizing my [research efforts](https://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu), and so little into organizing the things I've done that are actually significant to my loved ones.

So, I've created this site to gather together in one place stories and posts and essays and pictures and music.  Some of these things I haven't looked at in many years, and it was fun to see them again.
