young---maybe five years old or so. When we were this young, Chicky Taylor and I used to play together a lot: after school, on weekends, and during the summer time.</p><p>While sometimes we would be driven to the Pier to go swimming or to play on the playground, more often we would simply play together at either his house or at my house. If we played at my house, we would usually go down the basement, and maybe play ping-pong. If we played at his house, we might also play in his basement, or else watch TV in their den, or play in his backyard. Chicky&#x27;s backyard was a little better for playing in than our backyard, since it was fenced in so that balls would not escape into the street.</p><p>Well, on this particular day, Chicky Taylor and I tried playing in his basement, but there was nothing fun to do down there. So then we went upstairs to his bedroom, but nothing seemed fun to do up there either. Then we went into his backyard, but we still couldn&#x27;t think of anything to do: Basically, Chicky Taylor and I were bored. And do you know what happens when little boys get bored?</p><p>(This was the always-waited-for moment when Katie and Jenna would get to say, &quot;They get into TROUBLE!&quot;)</p><p>Yes, that&#x27;s right. Now, to understand why we got into trouble, you need to understand that our houses were facing each other on opposite sides of Ridge Road. They were actually quite close to each other, maybe only 50 feet apart, but Ridge Road had a certain amount of traffic on it. Thus, when Chicky Taylor and I were small, we weren&#x27;t allowed to cross the street by ourselves to go to each other&#x27;s houses. Instead, we had to ask our Moms to come out of the house and walk us across the road.</p><p>Now, you know Moms. They are often cooking, or cleaning, or talking on the phone, or doing something that creates delays when a small boy wants to go across the street to play.</p><p>So, Chicky Taylor and I decided that day that we should dig a tunnel from his backyard to my front yard, which would be fun because we could play with shovels, and also useful because afterwards we wouldn&#x27;t need to ask our Moms to help us cross the street. So we went into Chicky Taylor&#x27;s garage and found two shovels, and went back to the backyard and decided that the perfect spot to begin digging the tunnel was in the corner of the yard, just next to the fence that overlooked Ridge Road.</p><p>Of course, there was a nice row of flowers and bushes there, but we didn&#x27;t worry ourselves about them in the slightest. We started digging and throwing dirt around, and after maybe ten or fifteen minutes, we had dug a hole about waist high (for five year olds). We had also managed to get ourselves, the surrounding lawn, the flowers, the bushes, and the fence covered with dirt. And, we were thirsty.</p><p>So, we climbed out of the hole and trotted into the house to look in the refrigerator for something to drink. Mrs. Taylor happened to be in the kitchen at that moment, cooking dinner, when she saw two small boys, covered with dirt and leaving muddy footprints walking into her kitchen. Mrs. Taylor said,</p><p>&quot;Boys, what have you been doing?&quot; To which we answered:</p><p>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p><p>Well. After a few more questions, she marched us out to the backyard, saw the hole and the trampled flowers around it, and made us fill it back in and try to fix the plants as best we could.</p><p>Then, I was marched back across the street to my house by Mrs. Taylor, who explained to my Mother just what Chicky and I had been doing and why I was now covered with dirt. My Mother made me take a bath right away.</p><p>And that&#x27;s the story of Chicky Taylor and the Tunnel.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"></div><div class="col lastUpdated_mt2f"><span class="theme-last-updated">Last updated<!-- --> on <b><time datetime="2021-12-05T23:57:26.000Z">12/5/2021</time></b> by <b>Philip Johnson</b></span></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/chickytaylor/first-time"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« <!-- -->The first time I met Chicky Taylor</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/chickytaylor/little-league"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Chicky Taylor and Little League<!-- --> Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">No rights reserved</div></div></div></footer></div>
