There were a lot of things to do at his house: he had a den where we could watch TV, his backyard was good for playing baseball, we could play cards in his bedroom, and most especially, he had a basement with lots of fun stuff to do in it.</p><p>For some reason, on this particular day, we couldn&#x27;t find anything to do. Basically, we were bored. And do you know what happens to two boys when they get bored?</p><p>(Sounds of young girls proclaiming loudly, &quot;They get into TROUBLE!&quot;)</p><p>That&#x27;s right. On this particular afternoon, we were downstairs in Chicky Taylor&#x27;s basement. To understand this story, you need to know how Chicky Taylor&#x27;s basement was laid out. There were four rooms in Chicky Taylor&#x27;s basement, and two staircases from the basement up to the rest of the house. If you came down the staircase from the front of the house, which was carpeted, you arrived in a kind of basement foyer, with three rooms branching off from it. One room had a couch, a fireplace, and a pool table. The second room had a ping-pong table and a floor-to-ceiling built-in shelving unit where there were lots of games like Operation, Clue, Trouble, and so forth. The third room contained stuff for Mr. and Mrs. Taylor, including tools, the washer and dryer, and a freezer. The third room also had a staircase, which was not carpeted, that went up to the kitchen.</p><p>We were allowed to play as much as we wanted in any of the rooms except the third room, although we could walk through it to use the back staircase to the kitchen. But there wasn&#x27;t anything in there that was appropriate for small boys.</p><p>That didn&#x27;t mean that there wasn&#x27;t anything in there that wasn&#x27;t interesting to young boys.</p><p>So, on this day, we found ourselves looking around the third room. First we checked out the corner where Mr. Taylor kept his tools. This was quite interesting to us: there were hammers and nails and screwdrivers and drills. We might have made a few tentative taps with the hammer.</p><p>Then, we took a quick look at the washing machine and dryer, but that wasn&#x27;t very interesting apart from a few knobs and dials.</p><p>Then, we got to the freezer. This was one of those freezers that were waist high, and opened from the top. Chicky and I opened it up and took a look inside. There were packages of frozen meat, and frozen vegetables, and this being the 1960&#x27;s, probably some frozen TV dinners.</p><p>There were also several tubes of frozen cookie dough.</p><p>Chicky and I took a tube of frozen cookie dough out of the freezer.</p><p>Our stomachs started to growl, as we looked a the picture of cookies on the wrapping.</p><p>Then, we peeled off some of the wrapping, and took a tentative nibble at the frozen cookie dough. It was delicious! We passed it back and forth a few times, gnawing on the cookie dough tube.</p><p>Then we heard footsteps! It was Mrs. Taylor coming down the back stairs from the kitchen! Fortunately for us, the back stairs were not carpeted like the front stairs, so we could hear her coming down.</p><p>We had only a few seconds to figure out what to do. Chicky tossed the cookie dough tube back into the freezer, we slammed the freezer cover closed, and jumped on top of the freezer.</p><p>That was how Mrs. Taylor saw us when she entered the basement. Obviously surprised to see us nonchalantly sitting on top of the freezer, she said, &quot;Boys! What are you doing?&quot;</p><p>To which we replied, &quot;Nothing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, then, would you please get off the freezer, because I need to get something in there.&quot;</p><p>Oh, no, we thought! But we got off the freezer, and stood off to the side as Mrs. Taylor opened up the lid and started rummaging around inside for whatever it was she wanted. After a couple of seconds she lifted out a package of frozen hamburger and started to close the top of the freezer. Chicky and I thought we had escaped.</p><p>But, just as she was about to close the door, she stopped, put the hamburger package down, reached back in the freezer, and pulled out a partially-eaten tube of frozen cookie dough.</p><p>I think at first she thought that mice had gotten into the freezer, because of the little teeth marks on the cookie dough. But then she then turned around and took a closer look at us.</p><p>&quot;Boys. What is that on your faces?&quot;</p><p>Both of us immediately wiped our face with our sleeves, then looked down and saw chocolate on our shirts.</p><p>&quot;Boys. Have you been eating the chocolate chip cookie dough?&quot;</p><p>Chicky Taylor and I looked at each other in desperation, but neither of us had any idea how to avoid admitting the truth.</p><p>&quot;Yes&quot;, we said in a small voice.</p><p>Well, we then got a good scolding. First, we were scolded for playing in a room of the basement where we weren&#x27;t supposed to be. Then, we were scolded for going in the freezer which we weren&#x27;t supposed to go in. Then, we were scolded for eating the cookie dough. Finally, we were scolded for attempting to hide what we were doing from Mrs. Taylor.</p><p>I was sent home. However, that night, after dinner, Mrs. Taylor walked across the street to our house with a plate of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies, and told my parents what she had found the boys doing that day.</p><p>And that&#x27;s the story of Chicky Taylor and the Cookie Dough.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"></div><div class="col lastUpdated_mt2f"><span class="theme-last-updated">Last updated<!-- --> on <b><time datetime="2021-12-05T23:57:26.000Z">12/5/2021</time></b> by <b>Philip Johnson</b></span></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/chickytaylor/ketchup"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« <!-- -->Tom Montgomery and the Ketchup</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/fall14/introduction"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Introduction<!-- --> Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">No rights reserved</div></div></div></footer></div>
