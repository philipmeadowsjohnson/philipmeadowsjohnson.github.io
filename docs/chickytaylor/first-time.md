When my parents moved back to the States from England, I think I was around two or three years old. We moved to Grosse Pointe, but we didn't move to the house on Ridge Road that was across the street from Chicky Taylor's. What happened was that my parents rented a house on Merriweather Road while they looked around for a year or so for a house to buy, just like Mom and I rented the house on Ohana Street while we looked until we found the house on Kaimake Loop that we wanted to buy.

I remember only a few things from that house on Merriweather Road. For example, I remember the time Grandmother and Grandfather packed up the car to go off somewhere, and somehow forgot about me! I was playing in the house, and then everything was quiet, and I looked around, and nobody was home! I remember going outside to see if anyone was in the back yard, and when I didn't see anyone out there, I decided to go over to the next door neighbor's house and knock on their kitchen door. I don't remember what I was going to say, or do, but I do remember that right when the neighbor arrived at the door, Grandmother ran up and got me. I don't remember feeling scared, because it wasn't really a very long time that I was left alone. I think I was simply puzzled by the situation.

When Grandmother recounts the story, she says that she packed up the car, drove off down the road, and then from the front seat asked me a question, and when I didn't respond, she turned around to ask me again and realized I wasn't even there! In a panic, they turned the car around and zoomed back home to find me.

My parents looked at lots of different houses to buy that year, but the only one I remember was an old house that was right across the street from the Grosse Pointe Farms pier. That would have been a fun house to live in, but then I wouldn't have lived next door to Chicky Taylor!

Anyway. Grandmother and Grandfather eventually decided to buy the house at 207 Ridge Road. This house was so close to the house we were living in on Merriweather Road, that on the day that we moved, I actually walked from our old house to our new house. It was just one block away. I think Aunty Beth walked me over, because I was only four years old.

When we got to the house, we looked all around inside it, and I found out where my bedroom was going to be. Then Grandmother and Grandfather and Aunty Beth and Uncle Rob got very busy unpacking and doing all of the things that older people do when they have just moved into a house. I'm not sure what Aunty Gillian was doing right then, maybe she was having a nap. So, after I had looked around for a while, I decided to go outside.

First, I went into the backyard. There was a tall white flag pole, and a bunch of pine trees. Later, when I got older, I tried to climb one, and got sticky sap all over me.

Then I went into the front yard. There was a big tree right next to the front door, and I sat down next to it. And I looked across the street. And across the street was a square, brick, gray house.

And sitting on the grass, in front of that square, brick, gray house, watching people unload the moving van, was a small boy.

A small boy just like me.

So I stood up, and called out, "Hello!" And he said, "Hello", back to me. And I said, "What's your name?"

And he said, "Chicky Taylor".

And I said, "Do you want to play?" And he said, "I'll go ask my Mom."

And that was the first time I met Chicky Taylor.
