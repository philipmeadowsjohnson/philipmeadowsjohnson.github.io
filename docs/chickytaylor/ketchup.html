Ketchup</h1></header><p>Chicky Taylor doesn&#x27;t actually appear in this story, but it is a &quot;Chicky Taylor Story&quot; in all other respects, as you will see. And you will also understand after this story why, a few nights ago, I was horrified to see Katie shaking the salad dressing container at dinner without holding the top with her finger.</p><p>This story happened during the summer of, I think, eighth grade. I was going to Brownell Middle School, and I made several new friends there, including Bob Montgomery, who we all called &quot;Monty&quot;.</p><p>Monty had an older brother, Tom, who was already in high school and who pretty much epitomized the notion of &quot;cool&quot; in the mid-1970&#x27;s. First off, he was very nice and fun to be with. Second, he was captain of the swim team. Third, his bedroom was, as Wayne and Garth might put it, a &quot;Babe Lair&quot;. It was down in the basement of the Montgomery house, away from everything else, and dimly lit even in the daytime. The walls were covered with psychedelic posters and he had black lights for illumination. Most of the room was occupied by a huge, octagonal waterbed. Finally, he had a totally awesome quadrophonic stereo system with a nice selection of quadrophonic records---the only person I ever knew with a quad stereo. We would go down there and listen to songs like Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple and Roundabout by Yes. Not only did the music envelop you, it would actually spin around the room at times. It was incredible.</p><p>During this summer, the Montgomerys invited me to accompany them on a weekend trip up north to Boyne Mountain, which in the summer offered hiking, tennis, golf, canoeing, and swimming. The four Montgomerys and I headed off and I am sure that we had a good time up there, although I only clearly remember the car ride back home.</p><p>It takes at least five hours to drive between Detroit and Boyne City in the summer, and traffic could make it longer, and so you typically make a day of it: leave in the morning, stop for lunch, and arrive in the mid to late afternoon. We set off on Sunday to come home and stopped somewhere midway back for lunch. The restaurant was part of a golf course, because I can still remember that there were big picture windows that looked out from the restaurant over a golf course.</p><p>The restaurant was fairly crowded when we arrived with people who had just come from church, and so most people were dressed up: the men had on suits and ties, and the women were wearing nice dresses. We, of course, were in vacation mode and so we weren&#x27;t dressed nearly as nicely as everyone else.</p><p>So, we sat down at a table and ordered hamburgers and french fries and so forth. In a few minutes, the food came, and Tom reached out for the ketchup bottle. Instead of simply opening up the bottle and pouring the ketchup out, Tom decided to shake it first.</p><p>Well. Monty and I were sitting directly across the table from Tom, so we had a front row seat for what happened next. Unfortunately for Tom, the previous user of the ketchup bottle had neglected to actually screw the bottle cap tight, but instead simply placed the cap onto the top of the bottle. So, upon Tom&#x27;s first vigorous shake of the bottle, the top went flying off backwards over his right shoulder. Monty and I both reacted, but not in time to stop Tom before his second shake of the bottle, which resulted in a large glob of ketchup escaping the confines of the bottle, soaring through the air, and landing smack dab onto the tie of a gentleman at the table behind us.</p><p>There then occurred one of those moments where time seems to stand still. I think we all looked at Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery for direction. What do we do now? Of course, with thirty years to reflect upon the situation, I now know what should have happened. Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery should have reacted with a shocked look, followed by a quick reprimand to Tom for being so careless with the ketchup, and finally with an immediate expression of concern and remorse to the diner whose lunch had been so abruptly interrupted.</p><p>That&#x27;s what should have happened, but Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery, being only human, and without the benefit of thirty years of reflection, reacted instead by first attempting to repress a smile, which failed, and then let loose with a giggle. That was too much for the rest of us, so we started to giggle as well. Within about five seconds our entire table was trying to restrain ourselves from laughing, and failing miserably.</p><p>I can only imagine what that poor gentleman thought at that moment: not only did those poorly dressed people at the next table make a direct hit on his person with a ketchup bomb, but they were now---adults included!--- laughing about it!</p><p>Of course, Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery recovered their composure quickly and went over to the table and offered their sincerest apologies for the mishap, along with an offer to pay for cleaning or replacing of the tie as the fellow wished. I remember that he refused and seemed quite put out by the whole incident.</p><p>I don&#x27;t remember anything about the rest of the meal, but I do remember that as soon as we got back to the privacy of our car, we spent a good part of the drive home laughing hysterically about the incident.</p><p>And that&#x27;s the story of Tom Montgomery and the Ketchup.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"></div><div class="col lastUpdated_mt2f"><span class="theme-last-updated">Last updated<!-- --> on <b><time datetime="2021-12-05T23:57:26.000Z">12/5/2021</time></b> by <b>Philip Johnson</b></span></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/chickytaylor/home-run"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« <!-- -->Chicky Taylor and the Home Run</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/chickytaylor/cookie-dough"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Chicky Taylor and the Cookie Dough<!-- --> Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">No rights reserved</div></div></div></footer></div>
