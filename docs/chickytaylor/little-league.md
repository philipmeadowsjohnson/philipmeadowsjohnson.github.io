For as long as I can remember, one of the favorite things that Chicky Taylor and I liked to do together in the summer was play baseball. When we were small, we would play baseball in Chicky's backyard.

In Grosse Pointe, back in those days, you had to be ten years old to play Little League. My birthday was in late December, and Chicky Taylor's was in early January, so we both turned 10 years old at the same time. This meant that in early May, when the snow had finally all melted away but the ground was still muddy, and the temperature was warm enough that you could go outside with a light jacket on, it was time for Little League tryouts.

I remember that Chicky Taylor and I prepared for these tryouts with great industriousness. All through April we practiced our pitching, our batting, and our fielding in his backyard whenever the weather allowed us and the ground was dry enough. I am pretty sure that every kid who went to the tryouts was placed on a team, but I am also pretty sure that we did not know that at the time. I think I was a little afraid I might not make it onto a team.

At last the day arrived for Little League tryouts, and Chicky and I got our gloves and rode our bikes a few blocks down Ridge Road to the park behind the Grosse Pointe Village stores where the tryouts were being held.

There were some Dads there who were supervising, and a whole lot of young boys. I don't think girls could try out for Little League back in 1968. Anyway, they pitched us some balls which we attempted to hit, they batted some balls out to us that we attempted to field, and they took notes on clipboards. I don't remember anything embarrassing happening and after an hour or so we finished and rode back home to wait for the Phone Call.

A few days later, I got the word. I was drafted onto a team called Miami. I called Chicky, and found out that he was on a team called Rochester. A week later, practices started and we received the schedule of games. It turned out that Miami was playing against Rochester in the very first game of the season!

Well, this was a big event for both our families. It got even more exciting (for them, anyway) when it turned out that Chicky would be the starting pitcher for Rochester, and I would be the starting pitcher for Miami. I guess our backyard practices had paid off.

The first game was held at a big field down by Mack Avenue. It was the first time that I had been in an official baseball game, with an umpire, coaches, real bags on the bases, uniforms, chalk lines, and so forth. I remember I was a little intimidated by all of this. It was quite different from Chicky Taylor's backyard. I remember that both the Taylor family and my family were in the stands and sitting together, even though their kids were on opposite teams.

At the end of the sixth and final inning, Rochester was ahead and won the game. I don't remember feeling that bad about losing, because after all, my best friend was the winning pitcher. And, anyway, our families told us we had both done very well, and best of all, we all went to Dairy Queen for ice cream cones after the game.

And that's the story of Chicky Taylor and Little League.
