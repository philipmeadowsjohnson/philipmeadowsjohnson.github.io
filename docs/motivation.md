Katie asked me recently, "Dad, have you ever thought of writing a memoir?" I scoffed at the idea, because it seemed both narcissistic and the results would be so boring.

But it got me thinking about the artifacts of my family's life, and how I was the only one who knew where many of these artifacts were located, and how my family might never find them again if (for example) COVID takes me down.

So, I've created this site to gather together family stories and posts and essays and pictures and music.  Some of these things I haven't looked at in many years, and it was so fun to see them again. 

As the site name suggests, this is my virtual version of [Darryl Kerrigan's pool room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYY-0N09fHI). It evokes what is most precious to me: memories of happy times spent with loved ones. And if COVID doesn't take me down, hopefully there will be more things to go straight to the pool room in the coming years. 

Finally, if you look carefully, you will find that there is one person who dances in and out of the frame throughout these memories, rarely in the pictures (because she was usually the one taking them), but always significant, and always inspiring. My love, my muse, this is above all for you, so you can more easily remember our life together.
