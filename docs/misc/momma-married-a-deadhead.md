*Seems like I composed this right before Jenna's wedding.* 

I can still hear the plaintive voice of Jerry  
From the back seat on the way to middle school  
Dad would give a lecture on the allegories  
In Jack Straw, Wharf Rat and Ship of Fools  

He'd play me jams when I was in my jammies  
I'd fall asleep to mixolydian scales in E  
Sometimes I'd see him fumble with his capo  
But never with Friend of the Devil in G  

Oh, Momma married a DeadHead  
I hear they went to shows  
And what they did or saw there  
Only Uncle Larry knows  
They dressed me up in tie-dye  
From my head down to my toes  
Momma married herself a DeadHead  
Not the worst thing I suppose  

Dad and Larry are playing at my wedding  
The setlist is a secret to me  
Cold Rain and Snow is definitely a no-go  
I wouldn't mind a lively Sugaree  

Oh Momma married a DeadHead  
Did she think it was a phase?  
Did she hope he'd move on musically  
To EDM if not shoe gaze?  
Does she find it disconcerting  
That the Dead is all he plays?  
Now she's stuck in Spring 77  
For the remainder of her days.  

I'm grown up and I like all kinds of music  
Kanye West and Beyonce are pretty cool  
But I must confess I have a little soft spot  
For Mississippi Half-Step Toodleoo  

Oh Momma married a DeadHead  
I hear they went to shows  
Was she twirling by the soundboard  
In psychedelic hippie clothes?  
Was she eating a tuna sandwich  
When the parking lot was closed?  
Oh Momma married a DeadHead,  
Momma married a DeadHead,  
Momma married a DeadHead,  
Not the worst thing I suppose.
