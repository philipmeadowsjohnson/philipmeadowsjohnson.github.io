*(An email I sent to my family in 2001)*

My dear family,

Beth sent me a package recently with some documents unearthed at 11 Provencal Rd.  I can see why this information has been hidden from me for so long: it provides stunning new insight into the root causes of my current misfortune. I feel the need to share this with all of you so that you realize that I'm not responsible for my current situation: it all goes back to some tragic parenting decisions made during my early years.  Indeed, the ominous signs were there for all to see as early as pre-kindergarten:

### December, 1962. Pre-Kindergarten teacher comments:

Philip needs more time to make a better adjustment to school... I am trying to help Philip listen, follow directions, and try to solve his own problems.

### May, 1963, Pre-Kindergarten teacher comments

(Philip) continues to show immaturity in small muscle work, coordination, following directions.  He cries easily, and gets upset over simple problems.  He needs to listen in group situations and accept responsibility.  As you know, we question the advisability of him going on to kindergarten next year, because of his age and his immaturity in certain areas...

*(Clearly, I was crying out for help (literally and figuratively).  Perhaps due to teacher recommendation, or perhaps due to a court order, I was then sent to a shrink.)*

### May, 1963. "PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION", by M. Nadjisky (excerpts)

Philip is an adequately sized little boy of not quite 4 1/2 years old, who has a thick head of light hair, blue eyes, and was wearing khaki shorts with a pink shirt, white socks, and black tennis shoes.  He is a charming child, with a clear "sunny" facial expression ...

His use of language is well developed, with now and again a more adult-like phrase as when he said, "I actually know when it is in", referring to the month of his birthday, which then after much thought he could not remember.  He talked of his brother Bobby, "He is my brother that lives with me", and of Bobby's electric train.  His vocabular definitions were occasionally excellent and stated in his own special way, as for instance a puddle, "a puddle that you have to not step in".  When difficult material was presented to him, he gave a matter-of-fact answer that he did not know, and did not seem unduly concerned about it ...

Summary and recommendation: ... In no way would it be a reflection upon him to consider that time and maturation, as for instance his being a year older before he enters kindergarten, would be a wise plan. As you know, there have been only a few children of his age who have moved on into the kindergarten without repeating another year, and these few children have in their test performances demonstrated clearly very superior development in all areas ...  It would seem to me ... that this boy not be considered (for kindergarten), and that an additional year before kindergarten could include extra enriching experiences planned by the family.  This is, as you know, a difficult recommendation for some parents to visualize, since there is often no concrete evidence for some years what the risk has been.

*(Now wait a second.  No concrete evidence?  My teachers have already indicated that "I cry easily" and "get upset over simple problems"!  I would think that the risks were already quite visible.  At any rate, we now have documented evidence that what I desperately needed in 1963 was "extra enriching experiences planned by the family".  But did I receive them?  Was I offered, for example, more time of my own with Bobby's electric train?  I think we all know the answer to that one.  No, it is clear that Mother and Father failed completely to "visualize" appropriate enrichments for poor little Philip, and it is my sad duty to now present the "concrete evidence" that Dr. Nadjisky so presciently predicted.)*

### First grade teacher report card comments (1964)

Philip could, I feel, do better class work, as he is inclined to be careless and in a hurry ... I hope we see more improvement in his penmanship next term.  Philip needs to be pushed, and then sprinkled with love.

*(I don't remember ever being pushed. I do, however, vividly remember Mother dislocating my thumb with a football "bullet pass", and then the emergency room doctor "sprinkling me with love" (or was it novocaine) as he shoved the errant digit back into its socket.)*

### Second grade teacher report card comments (1965)

Philip is a child with outstanding capabilities.  He is not, however, using them. He has a gift for expressing his ideas both orally and in written form.  However, his disorganized and inorderly developmental pattern is interfering with the fine progress we hope he will eventually make. Reading grade: N (Unsatisfactory Progress)

*(OK, it appears that I must now (reluctantly) give Mother some credit, because she did turn around the reading situation as noted in the next commentary.  However, the curse of having been thrown into academia prematurely continues to trouble me.)*

### Third grade teacher report card comments: (1966)

Philip's keen sense of enjoyment in reading is an incentive to the other children.  However, he rushes through all lessons, except reading.  I hope his interest in other subject areas will grow and develop and raise the low standards he often sets.

### Fourth grade teacher report card comments (1967)

At times (Philip) tends to be messy in his rush to complete the assignment.  His work has greatly suffered from his rushing and careless completion of assignments.

### Fifth grade teacher report card comments (1968)

Philip is doing very well in all areas except science.

*(Well, there you have it.  Low standards.  Rushing.  Messiness.  A complete failure to utilize my "outstanding capabilities".  And on top of everything else, scientific weakness.  To think that all of this could have been averted had I simply been allowed to spend one additional year in pre-kindergarten.)*

Mother and Father, the evidence is clear: I have you, more than anyone else, to blame for my current academic, social, familial, and financial status.

I can't thank you enough.

Much love Philip
