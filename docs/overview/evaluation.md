We will evaluate InternAloha in two ways.  In Back-End Evaluation, we will evaluate how well InternAloha is able to extract information from the Internet about Internships. In Front-End Evaluation, we will evaluate how well InternAloha satisfies the needs of students who are searching for an Internship.

## Back-End Evaluation

Evaluating the ability of InternAloha to extract information from the Internet involves answer the following questions:

* Does InternAloha get data from a reasonable number of popular internship sites for CS students?  Are there significant internship opportunities that are not found by InternAloha.

* For each site monitored by InternAloha, what percentage of the interesting listings does it extract?

* How good is the parsing of each site monitored by InternAloha? Does it extract all of the important information?

Back-End Evaluation does not involve user interface or user experience evaluation.  That is the task of front-end evaluation.


## Front-End Evaluation

InternAloha will be integrated into RadGrad as an "Internships" page where Internships matching the student's Interests and Career Goals will be displayed.

Evaluating the ability of InternAloha to address the needs of students seeking internships involves answering the following questions:

* Can InternAloha lower the time required for students to search for internships, and create a
higher success rate for students seeking internships?

* Do students find that InternAloha improves the internship search process? If so, how? If not, why
 not? How could InternAloha provide more support for the internship search process?

* Do students find the InternAloha easy to navigate? What could be improved?

* Does the information regarding student internships from InternAloha provide valuable feedback
 towards the ICS program at UH?
