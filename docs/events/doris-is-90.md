We celebrated Doris' 90th birthday in 2014 at her home in Naples.

I composed a song for the occasion, to the tune of the Grateful Dead's Casey Jones:

Driving that car 100 miles per hour  
Doris Johnson better watch your speed  
Kids in the front, kids in the back  
No husband in the car to give her flack.  

Doris left Texas in 1945  
With a yankee husband and some tearful goodbyes  
Had a daughter named Linda in '49  
But we all called her Beth and she changed it in time.  

(Chorus)

The kids grew up, oh, they're running amok,  
Rob got caught with his friend smoking pot  
Beth dropped out of school, Philip married a Jew,  
And back to Texas poor Gillian flew.  

(Chorus)

Golfing with you is like going to school  
You read the Times every day, you ain't nobody's fool  
You drive a soft top Audi, you're the dame of RP  
You're the role model that we all wish we could be.
