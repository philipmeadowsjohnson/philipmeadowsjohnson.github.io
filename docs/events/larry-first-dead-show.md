In 2017, Larry organized a party, ostensibly to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of attending his first Grateful Dead show. In reality, it was a reason to bring together his friends who shared a passion for the Dead to tell stories and play music.   The event coincided with a trip where Rob took all of us (Joanne, Katie, Jenna, Asa, Larry, Beatrice, and I) to see John McLaughlin in San Francisco. So, Beatrice and Rob got to attend the party and experience Grateful Dead culture in all its glory. 

Many stories were told, but here are two from the family.
