Lots of families have annual get-togethers, traditions that build momentum and meaning over the years. For my family, that tradition is the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. 

### Our first JazzFest

Joanne and I went to our first JazzFest in 2010, right after Katie went to college and as part of celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. At that point, it was not at all clear it would be a tradition.  Joanne was quite worried that she wouldn't be able to handle the large and unruly crowds.  We discovered that large, unruly crowds are only one of the many potential discomforts from attending JazzFest, and that neither Joanne or I could care less about any of those problems. We fell madly in love with the town, the music, the food, the streetcars, the people----basically everything about the experience. 

When we got home from our first JazzFest I made a home movie to try to document the experience for friends and family.

### Krewe d'Aloha

One of our favorite breakfast spots in New Orleans is Ruby Slipper, and at breakfast one year we had the idea of creating our own "Krewe" as a fun way of connecting and celebrating the friends and family who came to JazzFest.  The "Krewe d'Aloha" was born, and in the following years we made t-shirts and a flag. 

We also started the tradition of a "Krewe d'Aloha Board Meeting", which would take place at Ruby Slipper, near the end of JazzFest, and using paper napkins to record the meeting notes, which include such gems as:

*Raise money, establish goal for Krewe. Jello shots?*  
*Do we need a drone?*  
*Join AARP to get 2 drinks per day!*

Here are the meeting notes:

### JazzFest Review (2018)

In 2018, Asa came for the first time. This short video with Katie, Jenna, Asa, Doug, and Joanne captures the vibe of the thing:

### Ohio

One of the great things about JazzFest isn't actually JazzFest, it's the night time music.  Here is a snippet of Anders Osborne playing with Galactic at Tipitina's doing a cover of Ohio by Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.  Equally cool things are happening all the time in New Orleans, it's why you have to go back every year.

### Summertime in New Orleans

Doug Dirt had a medical event in 2012 and I recorded one of my favorite songs about New Orleans by Anders Osborne to try to help cheer him up:
