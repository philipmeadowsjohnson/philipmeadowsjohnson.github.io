For Joanne's 63rd birthday, I tried to write her a song. After finishing it (somewhat), I thought it might be fun to create a video around it where her friends and family could send birthday greetings (because COVID). I sent out an email with the following:

### The request

*Aloha, family and friends,*

*Joanne, like many of us, acutely misses contact with family and friends as COVID-induced isolation plows on.*

*Since she won't be able to party with any of you in person on her birthday (Monday, September 27), I thought it might be fun to create an "Animated Birthday Card" where you can send her birthday greetings.*

*I ended up writing and recording a simple little song for the occasion. I'm hoping each of you can record a 5-10 second video snippet, email it to me, and I will create a YouTube video including all of your greetings that she can "open" on her birthday.  I made a "draft" version of the video with sample ideas for greetings so you can see where this is going*

*Here are the lyrics:*

*Go find your party clothes my darling, Go find your dancing shoes*    
*We want to take away your sadness, Take away your blues*  
*Go find your jangle bangles, Go find your sparkle glass*  
*Can you hear the music playing, Feel your feet in the grass?*  

*OK, it’s a shit show out there, The clowns are in control*  
*The planet’s sick and tired of humans, But we see beauty in your soul*  

*Let’s open up a bottle of white wine, Let’s light a candle or two*  
*Maybe play a little music, Change our point of view*  
*A walk on the beach is tempting, A phone call with your friends*  
*Let’s find the first starlight this evening, Watch the daylight end*  

*OK, this was not what we planned, In fact, plans are a joke*  
*All we can do is grab this moment, Jump off the cliff, go for broke*  
*OK, we’re surrounded with sadness, Bad news every day*  
*But when we talk with you my darling, It seems like things might be OK.*  

*So, here's the ask:*

*First, by September 22, please email me a 5-10 second video greeting using your phone in portrait orientation. Please make sure it includes your face(s) so she knows who it is from.  The audio from your video will be muted, so please make sure your greeting is visual. Please don't text the video to me, because videos in text messages are low quality. Instead, please email your video as an attachment to johnson@hawaii.edu (and use the highest quality setting if given a choice).  I can do editing, don't worry if there's extraneous "setup" or "takedown" video at either end.*

*Second, if you are inspired, or uninhibited, or both, please email me as many additional video clips as you want by September 22. You can be dancing, romancing, drinking, jumping, painting, whatever.  I will try to creatively edit these into the mix. Again, your audio will be muted. The goofier the better. This will not go to Facebook!*

*Finally, I am generally contacting only one member of each family unit, so if you receive this, please know that I hope that all of your family members will participate!*

Here is the "sample" video I sent them:

### The response

I received an overwhelming response; it was so great!  In fact, there were so many submissions that I had to add a second song to the video in order to accomodate all of them.  Here is the video:

### Joanne's thank you

Joanne was, predictably, overwhelmed. She made this short little video to thank everyone
