title: Learning to Phish (2021)

One of the few bright spots of the pandemic for Joanne and I was the forty or so Phish shows that we watched from our couch.  From the "Dinner and a Movie" series to the Beacon Jams, we became acquainted with the nuances of Phish 1.0 vs. 2.0 vs. 3.0 (vs. the currently controversial post-pandemic "4.0"), the importance of "CK5" to the Phish show experience, and the musical differences between Phish and, say, the Trey Anastasio Band. Beyond music, it brought us closer to long-time family Phish Phans Kenny and Sarah.  I even posted an article to the Reddit Phish group: [A field guide to Deadheads and how to help them become Phish Phans](https://www.reddit.com/r/phish/comments/pd0tvv/a_field_guide_to_deadheads_and_how_to_help_them/). 

Given that I wasn't getting together with my usual musical suspects during this time, I made a few YouTube videos as a way to motivate myself to learn Phish tunes.  Here's a selection:
