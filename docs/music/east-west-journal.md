Around 1979, Larry and I started learning to play guitar. I borrowed Rob's Gibson guitar, Larry borrowed Joanne's nylon string guitar, and I went to a local bookstore and bought the "Grateful Dead Anthology" music book. We then thumbed through the book, looking for the easiest song to play, and came upon Wharf Rat.  To play this song correctly is not easy at all, but the intro to the tune alternates between Em (two fingers) and Asus2 (also two fingers), which seemed as easy as a tune could get. We were off!

Larry moved to California, and came back for Joanne's and my wedding.  Somehow, he ended up going on our honeymoon, and we played at a local bar on Ocracoke Island, calling ourselves "East-West Journal". Joanne was not exactly amused, but she was a good sport about the whole thing. (She now refers to this experience as "Larry and Philip's Honeymoon".)


## Audio Snippets (EWJ, 1980)

Anyway. Very little of our early musical adventures survives, but there is the following cassette tape that Larry made in the early '80s.  Intermixed with Grateful Dead music are tape recordings of he and I playing together, musical jams, and other hijinks.

And here is a recent snapshot of us.  Have we actually progressed in 40 years. Hard to say, you can be the judge.
