Over the years, I've played songs at various gatherings where I've composed new lyrics over existing melodies (sometimes known as "filking"). Here is a sampling.

## No Huli Kawai

*At the banquet after my first year at Kailua Canoe Club, I was somehow motivated to stand up and play the following song. It was a huge hit, and for many years afterward, various KCC paddlers would whisper "No huli Kawai" as they passed me.  The song is in honor of Kawai Mahoe, the first of many amazing and excellent coaches who taught me how to paddle.*

To the tune of: No Woman, No Cry (Bob Marley)

No huli Kawai, no huli Kawai.  
No huli Kawai, no huli Kawai.  

I remember when we used to sprint up the canal to Kailua Town.  
Observing the Open Men as they would mingle with the Novice B women.  

Good regattas we've won and good regattas we've lost along the way.  
In these great koa canoes you can't forget your past  
So grab your paddles and say:  

No huli Kawai (we stay dry), No huli Kawai  
Oh 12 and unders, don't be like us, No huli Kawai  

I remember when we used to camp at Bellows for the Blue and Gold,  
And then Donovan would make the fire light,  
with luck we'd roast marshmellows through the night.  

And then we'd grind on rice and chili of which we share with you.  
Our coolers are filled with liquid refreshments  
to keep us happy the whole night through  

Everything gonna be alright, Kailua always gonna fight.  
Coach Brah gonna lead us Sunday, Lanikai gonna eat our spray.  
12 and unders gonna drive Dar crazy, the Willetts gonna have a baby.  
Coach Kino gonna race with Frosh, then his cookies he gonna toss.  

So no huli Kawai, no huli Kawai.  

## Stroke It

*Emboldened by the success of No Huli, Kawai, I composed another song after my Novice A year that I played at the "Skit Night" for the KCC campout at Bellows. This was also very well received. I still think this one is pretty funny.*

To the tune of: Beat It (Michael Jackson)

You want to learn to paddle so you sign up in Spring  
You talk to Auntie Joan, tell her you don’t know a thing  
Mary takes your fee, now you are a Novice B,  
So Stroke It…  

We use the canal even though it is gross  
The water is flat, it helps Brah to coach  
You crank out the turns, in the straights you just burn  
You Stroke It, You don’t want to be bad  

Stroke It, Stroke It, don’t ever let the steersman poke it  
Twist from the waist, wait for the catch  
It’s the best way to make the boat fast  
Just Stroke It..  

One day after practice you meet a cute girl  
She paddles like an angel, she rocks your world  
You hook up at Blue and Gold, but by States it’s grown old  
So Stroke It..  

If you want to make crew for Kailua this year  
You gotta cross-train and lay off the beer  
Gotta make the boat fly and beat Lanikai  
And Stroke It…  


## Semi Century

*Larry had a big party for his 50th birthday, and I contributed this song.* 

To the tune of: Psycho Killer (Talking Heads)

I can't seem to remember the facts  
My hair is thinning;  it's gray in back  
I'm too young to retire  
My investments aren't exactly on fire...  

Semi-Century, qu'est-ce c'est.  
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   
Better get your colonoscopy today...  
Oh oh oh, Semi-Century, qu'est-ce que c'est  

You get a text message you can't even open it  
You talk a lot, you're not hearing too much.  
When I have pain in my knees, I don't complain,  
Say something once, I'll say it again.  

Semi-Century, qu'est-ce c'est.  
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa  
Better check your cholesterol today...  
Oh oh oh, Semi-Century, qu'est-ce que c'est  

Ce que j'ai fait, les annees passe  
Ce qu'elle a dit, les annees passe  
Realizon mon age avance, je me lance vers ton nez  

We all think we're still 25  
I like people who wear tie-dye  
Semi-century, qu'est-ce c'est  


## Covid Computer Science Blues

*In 2021, UH graduation was cancelled and the ICS faculty made a video to congratulate the graduating students. I contributed the following song.*

To the tune of: Momma just wants to barrelhouse all night long (Bruce Cockburn)

## Like a Rolling Johnstone

*In 1998, we had a family get-together in Burt Lake, Michigan. One afternoon, I was rowing a boat about 20 yards offshore when a Marine Conservation Officer pulled up in a power boat, noticed that I did not have any life preservers in the boat, and issued me a $40 ticket.  This incident led to the following song.*

To the tune of: Like a Rolling Stone (Bob Dylan)

Once upon a time you rowed so fine  
You threw the fish a line in your prime, didn’t you?  
Family called, they said “Ahoy, y’all”  
Come on out and have a ball,  
Well, didn’t you?  

You used to laugh about  
The marine conservation officers in their powerboat  
Now you don’t talk so loud.  
Now you don’t seem so proud  
About having to be posting your next bail.  

How does it feel  
To be on your boat  
Without a legal float  
Like a landlocked dolt  
Without a Cheboygan county vote  
A disenfranchised goat  
And the lake’s no bigger than a moat..  

You went to the finest Police Academy in Cheboygan County  
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.  
Nobody told you how to give citations on the lake and  
Now you’re just going to have to get used to it.  
You used to  be where it’s at  
Now you’re nothing but an aquatic bureaucrat  
Drifting on the lake in your evinrude  
Wishing you were back on land with a dude  
Your partner’s just a washed up prude  
You think you’re so shrewd  

How does it feel to be on Burt Lake  
Feeling like a flake  
Sucking Jet Ski wake  
Look at you now for goodness sake  
In your jack boots you quake  

Go to her, she summons you, you can’t refuse  
When you’ve got 40 dollars, you’ve got 40 dollars to lose  
You’re unsinkable now, you’ve got no floatation devices to conceal…  

How does it feel….
