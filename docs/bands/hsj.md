After leaving Shakadown Street, I quickly started to miss the experience of regularly playing music with good musicians. I wondered if there was a way to get the good parts of being in a band without the parts I didn't enjoy (i.e. staying up late at night). 

In 2016, I helped organize a "monthly jam session" to play Grateful Dead music. It was intended to be a super informal, no prep musical afternoon get-together.

I learned from this that it is difficult to maintain a "super informal, no prep" musical get-together, because it quickly becomes clear that with just a little bit of advance preparation, the music would sound so much better and the experience would be so much more fun.

So, we decided to create a setlist to be circulated in advance of the jam. That way, everyone could run through the tunes and at least have a basic understanding of the music. 

Once we prepared a bit for the jam sessions, the music sounded really good---or more precisely, there were moments when the music sounded really good.

By 2017, our informal jam sessions had evolved into performances at house parties with 30-100 people, preceded by rehearsals.  

In 2019, we played at a bar in Honolulu, and the transformation from "informal no-prep monthly afternoon jam" into "a band that stays up late at night to perform" was complete. 

Two things happened next: Justin decided he didn't want to participate in a band with three guitarists, and COVID put HSJ (and everything else) on hiatus. 

We are still figuring out what's next (if anything) for HSJ. 

I have maintained a site with pictures, videos, and sound snippets of Hardly Strictly Jerry over the years.
