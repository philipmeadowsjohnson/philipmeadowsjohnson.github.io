My friends Paul Perrone, Justin Murata, Steve Bazos, and I created a Grateful Dead band called Shakadown Street. We rehearsed every week on Thursdays for about six months prior to our first gig.  I learned a lot about how to learn to play music during this time.  Paul knows a lot about guitar gear, and with his advice and encouragement I bought a new amp and built up a pedal board from scratch.   We even had a [MySpace page](https://web.archive.org/web/20080707012550/http://www.myspace.com/shakadownstreet)!

### Sugaree 

Here's a video of a song from our very first gig, on the steps of Hawaii Hall at the University of Hawaii, for Earth Day in 2007.

### China Cat Sunflower

Apparently I got a haircut during the following year, as evidenced by the video for this gig in 2008. It looks like I might be wearing the exact same shirt, unfortunately.

### Posters

Here are a couple of event posters for the band.

### Denouement 

Similar to Mabanzi, after a few years of commitment, I got burned out on playing in the band. It stopped being fun and started being a drag, both physically and emotionally.  I am embarrassed to admit that a significant reason why I decided to leave Shakadown Street is that they wanted me to stay up past my bedtime. Steve Bazos, for example, had a friend with a show on Hawaii Public Radio on Saturday nights at midnight.  After playing the show twice, I said it was just too late for me.  Shakadown Street showed me that, even at its most amateur level, I am not cut out for the rock and roll lifestyle.
