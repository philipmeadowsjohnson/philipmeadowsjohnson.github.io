For a few years in the early 2000's, Joanne, Katie, and I all participated in a band called Mabanzi, originally organized by our friends Candice Pacheco and Chris Zorn.  Joanne and Katie learned how to play Shona music on marimba, and I attempted to learn rudimentary guitar lines.  It was super fun. 

According to the band's now-defunct website (via the Wayback Machine):

*Mabanzi was first formed in 2002 by a fortuitous set of circumstances bringing the only three people on Oahu who played Shona music together at a block party. Shortly after Chris Zorn moved to Oahu from Colorado where he had been teaching Shona marimba music for the last decade. Thus the first Shona marimba group in the islands was born. That group was called Matanzima and performed around the island. In 2003 the group changed personnel and became Mabanzi Marimba. Today Mabanzi has 12 members including the addition of vocals, guitar, bass and drums into the mix.*

*Instrumentation consists of seven marimbas (three sopranos, two tenors, a baritone, and a bass), gourd shakers called hosho, mbira ("thumb piano"), guitar, bass and drums. Performing original and traditional compositions and ancient mbira arrangements rooted in Zimbabwean styles and the songs are sung in the Shona language.*

Here are some pictures from our gig at a bar on Hotel Street in Honolulu, taken by Dan Suthers. This was by far my favorite gig in Mabanzi. The place was packed and by the end, everyone was sweating and dancing like crazy. In one photo you can see that the crowd is actually *in front of me*.  Was it OK that we let our daughter play music in a Chinatown bar at the tender age of 13? Yes!

Mabanzi was my first experience participating in an artistic collective.  I learned that the results of a dozen people working together collaboratively can be amazing. I also learned that it can be difficult to align the artistic goals of a dozen people over an extended period of time.  People tend to talk about "ego" as the reason for band drama, but ego was not the problem in Mabanzi for me.  What I found was that producing high quality art requires an intense focus and commitment, and that maintaining that level of energy over time is only possible when you get enough out of the experience to continue.  If your personal and artistic goals aren't aligned with everyone else's, it simply stops being fun and starts being a drag, and eventually you have to bow out.
