Rather than all of them and then just grey some out. (I later explained that it&#x27;s meant for when users create a profile and list their skills.

For Zip Recruiter specifically, some of the hyperlinks bring a person to the homepage instead of the direct listing. Some hyperlinks also might have changed to new listings as well, so we need to check whether each scraper does go to the right listings when clicked on. Inconsistencies with the CSS of the descriptions. Numerous duplicate job listings (Python Developer (Intern)). Expired jobs. Remove Bavaria, and State from locations.</p></li><li><p>There seems to be discourse of whether to have the scroll down or popup descriptions, but one thing for sure is to find a way to shorten the information to the most important stuff and also maintaining a succinct CSS for the descriptions.</p></li><li><p>Bug with infinite scroll. If users zoom out then try to scroll down, it doesn&#x27;t always load new listings.</p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="discussion">Discussion<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#discussion" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>My major take-away is that we are on the right track, but we need to do a better job of filtering. Here are a couple of ideas:</p><p><strong>Redesign the home page as a questionnaire.</strong></p><p>We need to know whether various filters are &quot;must have&quot;, or &quot;good to have&quot;. For example, some students only want to see paid internships. Some students only want US jobs.  I believe we can improve the UX by having students start by creating a kind of profile where we find out about &quot;required&quot; vs. &quot;desired&quot; attributes of the internship. Once they&#x27;ve filled this out, they can submit it to see results.  That way, we don&#x27;t inundate them with so much information right away.</p><p>The home page can also provide some details on what sites are scraped, how many listings we have, etc.</p><p><strong>Compute a &quot;score&quot; for each internship relative to the user profile, then present &quot;acceptable&quot; listings in descending order by score .</strong></p><p>The system might be more impactful if it helped the student to understand the level of match with their profile.</p><p>First, if a student indicates an attribute (such as &quot;local&quot;, or &quot;paid&quot;) as required, then only those internships that satisfy those required conditions are &quot;acceptable&quot; and presented in the results. From the acceptable listings, a score is computing based upon the level of match. A score of &quot;100&quot; would be a perfect match.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"></div><div class="col lastUpdated_mt2f"><span class="theme-last-updated">Last updated<!-- --> on <b><time datetime="2021-12-02T17:51:07.000Z">12/2/2021</time></b> by <b>Philip Johnson</b></span></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/documentation/use-mdx"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« <!-- -->Use MDX</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/pilot-studies/pilot-study-may-2021"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Pilot Study (May 2021)<!-- --> Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_vrFS thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#overview" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Overview</a></li><li><a href="#results" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Results</a></li><li><a href="#discussion" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Discussion</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">InternAloha is sponsored by:<br>
