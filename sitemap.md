Driving that car 100 miles per hour
Doris Johnson better watch your speed
Kids in the front, kids in the back
No husband in the car to give her flack.

Doris left Texas in 1945
With a yankee husband and some tearful goodbyes
Had a daughter named Linda in '49
But we all called her Beth and she changed it in time,

The kids grew up, oh, they're running amok,
Rob got caught with his friend smoking pot
Beth dropped out of school, Philip married a Jew,
And back to Texas poor Gillian flew.

Golfing with you is like going to school
You read the Times every day, you ain't nobody's fool
You drive a soft top Audi, you're the dame of RP
You're the role model that we all wish we could be.
